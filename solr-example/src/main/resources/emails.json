Negotiations continued for about one and a half hours outside\nthe building, ITAR-Tass and Interfax reported, citing witnesses.\nThe man later drove away from the building, under police escort, and drove\nto a street near Moscow\u0027s Olympic Penta Hotel, where authorities held\nfurther negotiations with him, the Moscow police press service said.

It was only\nas I did it again with a friend present, that he spotted the errors, and\nqueried them. We noticed that the hard linked files just didn\u0027t exist on\nthe new rootfs.\n\n When we duplicated the filesystems with dump instead of tar, it worked\nfine, I was able to tell lilo to use root\u003d/dev/md0 and everything worked.\n\n Woohoo.\n\nKate\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users\u0027 Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n",

    "message": "\nSpamAssassin is hurting democracy!\nOwen\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nhttp://www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/news/opinion/3900215.htm\n\nInternet can level the political playing field\nBy Mike McCurry and Larry Purpuro\n\nNOT many months from now, people across the country will experience one \nof the great recurring features of American democracy. At shopping \nmalls, on factory floors, at church socials and even on our front \nstoops, we will be approached by individuals who want to represent us in \npublic office. While chances are high that we won\u0027t know them \npersonally, they will walk up to us, offer a handshake and a flier and \nask for our votes.\n\nJust as technology is affecting every other area of communication, it \nhas begun to affect the way political candidates communicate with voters.\n\nIn this year\u0027s GOP gubernatorial primary, California Secretary of State \nBill Jones, who faced better-funded candidates, acquired the e-mail \naddresses of more than a million potential California voters and sent \neach an unsolicited e-mail asking for support.\n\nThat day, he might have chosen any of the more traditional -- and more \nexpensive -- methods of contacting voters, such as direct mail, radio \nspots or TV ads. But he spent only about 2 cents per message, instead of \n35 cents or more per message for direct mail or in another medium.\n\nHad Jones chosen direct mail, radio or TV, that communication would have \nbeen equally ``unsolicited,\u0027\u0027 as defined in the e-mail world. Few voters \nwould have ``opted in\u0027\u0027 to receive campaign information from Jones \nthrough any of those channels.\n\nThe response to Jones\u0027 e-mail effort, however, was swift and intense. He \nwas lambasted by anti-spam advocates, and media coverage was almost \nentirely negative. To be fair, some of Jones\u0027 tactics could have been \nrefined. He used a less-than-perfect list and no standard-practice \n``paid for\u0027\u0027 disclaimer in the message.\n\nHis detractors, however, attacked him not for his tactical miscues but \nbecause the e-mail was sent unsolicited. In fact, Jones\u0027 online campaign \nmay have been his most visible asset. In an era of cynicism toward money \nin politics -- money typically spent on other unsolicited communication \nmediums -- Jones tried to level the playing field.\n\nNo one likes commercial spam. It is irrelevant and untargeted and can be \nhighly intrusive and even offensive. But as a sophisticated society, \nit\u0027s time to differentiate commercial spam from very different \nunsolicited e-mail sent by political candidates to voters.\n\nThe debate is particularly relevant in light of legislation in Congress \nthat would constitute the first federal law to directly address spam. We \nbelieve e-mail is no more intrusive than direct mail, telemarketing or \nTV advertising when it comes to politicians seeking to reach voters. A \nsimple link in good e-mail campaigns allows recipients to opt out of \nfuture mailings. Direct mail takes at least a phone call or stamp to be \ntaken off a list, and viewers must repeatedly endure TV ads.\n\nWhen a candidate lacks a large campaign war chest, he or she can use the \nInternet to provide constituents with information to better prepare them \nto perform their civic duty of casting educated votes. With more than 60 \npercent of all potential voters in this country possessing e-mail \naccounts, it makes sense that political candidates use this medium.\n\nCandidates might avoid some of the tactical problems encountered by the \nJones campaign if they use the technologies available today that better \nensure quality of e-mail lists and target content to specific recipient \ngroups.\n\nBut the broader point remains. When a political candidate sends a voter \nan e-mail, that recipient can choose to delete the message without \nopening it, unsubscribe from the list, read it or even reply and engage \nthe sender. That choice should belong to the voter -- not to anti-spam \nadvocates whose efforts are better focused on commercial e-mail. \nPolitical candidates should be free to communicate with voters as best \nthey can, and let voters decide what to do with that information.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMike McCurry, former press secretary for President Clinton, is CEO of an \nadvocacy management and communications software company. Larry Purpuro, \nthe former Republican National Committee deputy chief of staff, is \nfounder and president of a political e-marketing firm. This was written \nfor the Los Angeles Times. \n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n",

It is based on the SysV unix family, so it\u0027s quite similar to\nother unixen like HPUX and SCO.\n\n Sun\u0027s hardware in general is more reliable, and a lot more expensive. One\nof the main bonuses you get by buying Sun is that you are getting your\nhardware and software from one company, so if you have a support contract,\nthey have to fix it. They can\u0027t fob you off with \u0027that\u0027s a software\nproblem, talk to the software vendor.\u0027 etc.\n\n If you are set on Linux, you most likely can do your own support. There\nis then a world of different hardware options. You can run Linux on Sparc,\nthough some companies like RedHat don\u0027t maintain a sparc port anymore.\n\n You can also buy your machine from linux-oriented companies like DNUK,\nwho do machines designed to run linux, and their own version of linux,\nthat has a few extras for their machines.

But going on that very\nbroad assumption, I guess I\u0027m describing\nthe flip side of Mr. Roger\u0027s experience:\nthe paisanos (who leave behind those who\nremain on a patron\u0027s rural land) move to\nManila, and (the second assumption) squat\nin shantytowns there, at least until they\ncan line up a middle-class job.\n\nSo, going on two large assumptions, I can\ncome up with a scenario under which title\nwould take 20 years: a shantytown arises\nsomewhere in the midst of a section (or\nwhatever the Spanish used to divvy up the\nland) and it takes decades of arguing to\nput together a package which somehow can\nboth compensate the owner and record lots\nfor the inhabitants.  Just transferring\ntitle to an existing lot, between parties\nwho have money, ought not to be a problem.\n\nThe obvious solution, at least to us\nbarking farting chihuahuas on FoRK, is\nto \"introduce market mechanisms\".  It is\nleft as an exercise to come up with one\nwhich works when many of the agents (are\nperceived to) have negligible NPV.\n\n-Dave\n\n\u003e              [land reform] meant that all the agricultural producers had\n\u003e to plant crops all the time (profitable or not) ...\n\nWhat happened to more highly-capitalized\nland?  Putting in trees instead of crops\nsounds like it might sidestep that.\n\n\u003e Mr. Long, I think you\u0027d particularly enjoy the De Soto work.\n\nOn the \"to find\" list.

    "message": "\nHi everybody!\n\nI\u0027m writing a web application in java (tomcat + jsp/servlets + database \naccess with postgreSQL).\n\nThis will be released under the GPL and will eventually be useful as a \nframework for other web applications.\n\nThe application main focus is e-commerce, but not limited to that.\n\nI would like to use some form of cryptography to protect data on the \ndatabase, but I have some problem figuring out the right approach.\n\nAbove all, how to store passwords and keys in a shared web server.\n\nA problem that I was unable to solve is how to store keys for \nencryption/decryption. The api that I\u0027m using is the jca (jdk1.4.x), \nand the methods of saving generated keys in keystores fails always. \n\nI can serialize the object, and store in the database, but this is not \nthe most secure approach: this key is needed to decrypt data in the \ndatabase, but the database is accessible from the web application. \nAssuming that I can find a good and secure place where to store the \ndatabase password, I can use a different database with different \nuser... Argh... to complex and doesn\u0027t really solve the problem.\n\nWhere I can found good documentation about this topic?\n\nThere is another approach that I would share with the list, something I \nthought that can be of bit interest, but probabily wrong and insecure. \nAfter all, I\u0027m a real beginner in secure programming, and I\u0027m here to \nlearn methods and technics.\n\nFirst of all, I need a secure way to keep database passwords secure, so \nI have to keep them separate from the main server. The right approach \ncould be using a small java bean application that run as normal user \n(not tomcat, so it is not shared with other web services or, worst, the \nnobody user), that has no shell login, but has a default home directory \nor a place where it can hold passwords and keys.\n\nThe web application could then open an ssl connection (could be done in \nthe init method at server startup) to get database passwords. The small \nbean could check via code signature/rmi/whatever else that the source \nis the right one, and handle all the database connections, or give the \ndb connection/password to the main web application.\n\nIn this way, we solve the problem of keeping the keys and passwords in \nshared directories, and also, an attacker should get root/bean user \naccount to read data. This is not perfect, and works only if your \nprovider gives the opportunity to configure a separated java \napplication (that means, really, another server running in the \nbackground).\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nThank you,\nMario Torre\n-- \nPlease avoid sending me Word or PowerPoint attachments.\nSee http://www.fsf.org/philosophy/no-word-attachments.html \n",

In the Sedit window, you\u0027ll see a Sign...\n\u003e menu item which will allow you to select between each of the listed \n\u003e .signature files for *that* e-mail.  You can actually use several if \n\u003e you\u0027d like (though I don\u0027t remember what Preferences... option allows \n\u003e for this).\n\u003e \n\u003e However, the signature gets added on send, not inserted directly into \n\u003e the existing Sedit window prior to composition.\n\u003e \n\u003e I currently have 6 different sig files I can choose between.\n\u003e \n\u003e Additionally, if a .signature file has the execute bit turned on, \n\u003e exmh will attempt to execute the file and use the stdout of the \n\u003e script as your signature.\n\u003e \n\u003e I hope this helps some.\n\u003e -- \n\u003e \n\u003e Seeya,\n\u003e Paul\n\u003e --\n\u003e \tIt may look like I\u0027m just sitting here doing nothing,\n\u003e    but I\u0027m really actively waiting for all my problems to go away.\n\u003e \n\u003e \t If you\u0027re not having fun, you\u0027re not doing it right!\n\u003e \n\u003e \n\u003e \n\u003e \n\u003e _______________________________________________\n\u003e Exmh-users mailing list\n\u003e Exmh-users@redhat.com\n\u003e https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-users\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nExmh-users mailing list\nExmh-users@redhat.com\nhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-users\n",

[Why was it that] a significant rate\nof capital formation was possible only in certain sectors and not in the\nwhole market economy of the time? ... It would perhaps be teasingly\nparadoxial to say that whatever was in short supply, money certainly was\nnot ... so this was an age where poor land was bought up and magnificent\ncountry residents built ... [How do we] resolve the contradiction ...\nbetween the depressed economic climate and the splendors of Florence\nunder Lorenzo the Magnificent?\n \n\n--------------\n\nDe Soto\u0027s theory is that the Bell Jar is formed when you segregate those\nwho have *practical* access to legal property rights and those who do\nnot.  The poor[1] have property -- lots and lots of property.  What they\ndon\u0027t have is access to the systems where we turn property into capital\nand allow it to start growing.  Their property can only be exchanged\nwith a small section of people who know them personally.\n\n[1] Actual poor people, not \u0027poor\u0027 Americans with a living standard that\nis the envy of most of the world.\n\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n",

Bush is dumb\"\nstory has been taken up by those who like their caricatures\ndrawn in stark, bold lines. According to scuttlebutt that\nemerged in the British press in July 2002, President Bush,\nBritain\u0027s Prime Minister Tony Blair, and France\u0027s President\nJacques Chirac were discussing economics and, in particular,\nthe decline of the French economy. \"The problem with the\nFrench,\" Bush afterwards confided in Blair, \"is that they don\u0027t\nhave a word for entrepreneur.\"\n\nThe source was Shirley Williams, also known as the Baroness\nWilliams of Crosby, who claimed \"my good friend Tony Blair\" had\nrecently regaled her with this anecdote in Brighton.\n\nLloyd Grove of The Washington Post was unable to reach Baroness\nWilliams to gain her confirmation of the tale, but he did\nreceive a call from Alastair Campbell, Blair\u0027s director of\ncommunications and strategy. \"I can tell you that the prime\nminister never heard George Bush say that, and he certainly\nnever told Shirley Williams that President Bush did say it,\"\nCampbell told The Post. \"If she put this in a speech, it must\nhave been a joke.\"\n\nThis is far from the first time Bush has been made the butt of\na jibe meant to showcase what some perceive as his less than\nstellar intellectual abilities. Without straining our memories\ntoo hard, we can come up with three other instances we\u0027ve\nchronicled on this site. In the summer of 2001, the joke of the\nmoment centered upon a supposed study that had resulted in the\nranking of Presidential IQs, with George W. Bush being pegged\nas the Chief Executive who scraped the bottom of the\nintelligence barrel. In December 2000 it was a fake Nostradamus\nquatrain which pontificated that the \"village idiot\" would win\nthe 2000 Presidential election. And in the spring of 2002, it\nwas the story of Bush\u0027s waving at Stevie Wonder that set folks\nto chortling up their sleeves.\n\nStories that illustrate this widely believed intellectual\nshortcoming will always waft after George W. Bush because they\nseemingly confirm what many already hold as true about this\npublic figure, that he\u0027s not the brightest fellow that\u0027s ever\nbeen. It is human nature to revel in yarns that the hearer at\nsome level agrees with, thus tales of this sort will always\nfall upon appreciative ears.\n\nBarbara \"ears of corn\" Mikkelson\n\nLast updated:   29 July 2002\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n",

I think some scripts or at least step-by-step\n\u003e instructions would be great. \n\u003e \n\u003e For example, to build a kernel RPM with ALSA do:\n\u003e 1. get the kernel source\n\u003e 2. get the ALSA source\n\u003e 3. run the custom-kernel.sh script\n\u003e ...\n\u003e \n\u003e Or a kernel RPM with the lastest wireless LAN drivers:\n\u003e 1. get the kernel source\n\u003e 2. get the CVS driver source\n\u003e 3. run the custom-kernel.sh script\n\u003e ...\n\u003e \n\u003e etc.\n\nThis wouldn\u0027t be worth the effort involved IMHO, and would probably end up\nin relative breakage of a few systems if not carefully tested.\nYour first example is a good one, because I really think it\u0027s even easier\ncurrently :\n1. Leave your current kernel as-is\n2. Get the \"alsa-driver\" source rpm\n3. Rebuild and install resulting packages\n\nDrivers that are written to be easily compiled as modules (like ltmodem,\nNVidia, ALSA etc.) can easily be repackaged separately as rpms and ported\nas easily for various kernel rpms from the source rpm.\n\nAlso, what you describe is sort of the opposite of what rpm packaging is in\nmy mind. I see it more as a \"one size fits all\" achievement in the general\ncase. And kernel isn\u0027t an exception (although there are packages optimized\nfor various processors) since they all come with just about all the modules\nyou\u0027ll ever need. Make that \"one size fits many\" then if you want ;-)\n\nLast but not least : The kernel is something I\u0027m trying to keep away from\nin my packaging since I really don\u0027t want to see newbies screwing up their\nsystems because of packages on my website... same goes for GNOME, KDE and\nother major bits of the distribution since I also want people who happily\nuse my packages to be able to upgrade to the next Red Hat Linux release\nwithout having their system turned into another Ximian mess.\n\nMatthias\n\nPS: Yes Chris, I\u0027m worried about not giving you too much work!

There\u0027s nobody\nleft to charge except the people who want (or are forced against their\nwill because their mail won\u0027t get through otherwise) to use the mark.\n\nConversely, if there are enough spammers forging the mark for Habeas to\nmake all its income suing them, then the mark is useless for the purpose\nfor which it was designed.\n\nEither way it seems to me that, after maybe a couple of lawsuits against\nreal spammers and a lot of cease-and-desist letters to clueless Mom\u0026Pops,\nthen either (a) they\u0027re out of business, (b) they have to sell the rights\nto use the mark to increasingly questionable senders, or (c) they\u0027ve both\ncreated and monopolized a market for \"internet postage stamps\" that\neverybody has to pay them for.\n\nThe latter would be quite a coup if they [*] could pull it off -- they do\nabsolutely nothing useful, unless you consider threatening people with\nlawsuits useful, yet still collect a fee either directly or indirectly\nfrom everyone on the internet -- effectively we\u0027ll be paying them for the\nprivilege of policing their trademark for them.

    "message": "\nSeverity: Security\nProduct: gaim\nKeywords: gaim hyperlink manual\nReferences: \n  CAN-2002-0989 \n    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name\u003dCAN-2002-0989\n  Gaim Changelog\n    http://gaim.sourceforge.net/ChangeLog\n\nGaim is an instant messaging client based on the published TOC\nprotocol from AOL. The developers of Gaim, an instant messenger client\nthat combines several different networks, found a vulnerability in the\nhyperlink handling code. The \u0027Manual\u0027 browser command passes an\nuntrusted string to the shell without escaping or reliable quoting,\npermitting an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the users\nmachine. Unfortunately, Gaim doesn\u0027t display the hyperlink before the\nuser clicks on it. Users who use other inbuilt browser commands aren\u0027t\nvulnerable.\n\nThe fixed version of Gaim no longer passes the user\u0027s manual browser\ncommand to the shell. Commands which contain the %s in quotes will\nneed to be amended, so they don\u0027t contain any quotes. The \u0027Manual\u0027\nbrowser command can be edited in the \u0027General\u0027 pane of the\n\u0027Preferences\u0027 dialog, which can be accessed by clicking \u0027Options\u0027 from\nthe login window, or \u0027Tools\u0027 and then \u0027Preferences\u0027 from the menu bar\nin the buddy list window.\n\nPlease download Gaim 0.59.1 or later using Red Carpet.

However, the additional \ninformation won\u0027t be required.\n\nThe opinion could encourage the adoption of text-based political ads, as \ncampaign experts look for new technological ways to sway voters. At the \nsame time, opponents of the plan fear it could lead to anonymous \npolitical spam.\n\nTarget Wireless, a small New Jersey-based wireless media company, had \nasked the FEC for an opinion on the matter, saying that requiring \nfinancial disclosures on short messaging service (SMS) mailings would \nuse up too much of the 160 character-maximum.\n\nPolitical messages on bumper stickers and buttons are also exempt from \nthe financial disclosure requirement. Target Wireless\u0027 petition was \nsupported by the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Cellular \nTelecommunications and Internet Association, and some advertising trade \ngroups.\n\nFEC spokesman Bob Biersack said the opinion was in keeping with the \ncommission\u0027s policy not to meddle with new technology that has the \npotential to reach more voters.\n\n\"We have tried very hard not to get in the way--particularly before \neveryone understands how the technology is going to work,\" he said.\n\nOpponents of the plan have worried the exemption might encourage spam or \nallow senders to blast people with mass amounts of negative political \nmessages while remaining anonymous.\n\nBiersack said the FEC can revisit the issue if those problems surface.\n\nTarget Wireless President Craig Krueger characterized the opinion as \n\"good for America.\"\n\n\"It will allow people to receive more communication from those running \nfor office,\" he said. \"We have free speech on our side.\"\n\n\n\n\n--------------080808010909060409040405--\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n",

    "message": "\n\nXviD [1] is a project to make GPL divx codecs. Sigma Designs [1] is a\ncompany  looking to put out hardware to playback, amongst other things,\ndivx files. Problem is Sigma is using XviDs gpled code in ways not very\ngpl. The  results....XviD stops work on thier code and ask the users to\nput preasure  on Sigma to honor the GPL.\n\nSome notes from other places....\n\n\u003e\u003eFrom Doom9 [3]\n\"XviD development has been stopped! The Sigma Designs REALMagic MPEG-4\nVideo Codec contains wide portions of code taken from the XviD project.\nSoon after the initial release of the REALMagic codec the XviD developers\nhave contacted Sigma and informed them about the GPL violation (for those\nwho don\u0027t know, XviD is distributed under the GNU Public License - GPL -\nwhich demands that if you modify a GPL program you have to release it\nunder the GPL, which in this case means that the source code of the Sigma\ncodec must be freely available). Sigma promised to replace the stolen\ncode, but the new version of the codec which was released this month only\ndisguises the stolen code, it was not actually removed. Sigma was once\nagain contacted and asked to remove the offending code but until today\nnothing has happened. Therefore the XviD team is now turning to the public\nin the hope to receive wide public support in their efforts to convince\nSigma Designs to respect the terms of the GPL. And until the matter has\nbeen resolved XviD development will not continue.\n\nThat being said I hope all the forum members who saw their threads about\nthe Sigma Codecs being closed will understand our motivation now.\nInternally we already knew what was going on but since the XviD authors\nfirst wanted to try and resolve this internally we respected their wishes\nand kept quiet about the matter at hand.\n\n[Update] Sigma has issued a press release announcing the availability of\nthe source code of their MPEG-4 codec and it\u0027s already up for download.\nHowever, not a word was lost about the XviD issue and the press release\nmakes one think that the Sigma codec was entirely developed by Sigma so we\nmight be hearing more about this.\n\n[Update] I found a GPL notice in some of the source code files, but it\nalso looks like Sigma placed their own copyright lines there and XviD\ndoesn\u0027t get any credit in the source either. The GPL notice also collides\nwith Sigma\u0027s Software Licensing Agreement that you have to sign before\ndownloading codec or source. On on the same issue DivXNetworks said they\u0027d\nfully support XviD in this issue and apparently DXn\u0027s relationship with\nSigma didn\u0027t really work out either, as Sigma\u0027s Xcard is not as DivX\ncompatible as it was advertised.\n\n[Update]First an update on the XviD situation. The release of the Sigma\nsource code does not mean it\u0027s all over, it\u0027s far from being over. The\nlicense agreement which you have to agree to before you can download, and\ninstall the codec is not compatible with the GPL. Furthermore, it can now\nclearly be seen (download the source code and have a look for yourself)\nthat the Sigma codec is pretty much a copy of the XviD codec, but all the\ncopyright notices of the original developers have been removed and\nreplaced. This does not only violate the GPL but copyright laws - you\ncan\u0027t just take a program, change a few lines and change the copyright\nstatements, you only have copyright protection for the parts you wrote on\nyour own. And related to this the Sigma codec also contains code taken\nfrom the OpenDivX project, the files were outfitted with 2 different\ncopyright notices which is quite funny.\"\n\n\n\n[1] http://www.xvid.org/\n[2] http://www.sigmadesigns.com\n[3] http://www.doom9.org/\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n",

    "message": "\nfrom http://www.arstechnica.com/\n\n\"There has mostly been talk thus far and little action, but the Department\nof Justice says it may be ready to file criminal lawsuits against\nindividuals [1] who distribute or receive unauthorized copyrighted\nmaterial over the Internet. Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Malcolm believes\nthat \"criminal prosecutions of copyright offenders are now necessary to\npreserve the viability of America\u0027s content industries.\" Malcolm also\nbelieves that people who trade copyrighted material think they are\nparticipating in a legal activity. I certainly think people who download\ncopyrighted works understand that such distribution--barring provisions\nsuch as fair use--is not authorized, and it is not surprising to see\nbusinesses continue to look for means to discourage distribution of\ncopyrighted works.\n\n\n\"Some prosecutions that make that clear could be very helpful...I think\nthey would think twice if they thought there was a risk of criminal\nprosecution,\" said [RIAA President Cary] Sherman, who was on the same\nconference panel.\n\nI\u0027m not too confident that lawsuits would have the effect Sherman is\nhoping for. Although infrequent, there have already been civil suits or\nwarnings issued to private individuals, and they have served as minor\ndeterrents to the file-sharing community at large. Criminal lawsuits\ncarrying with them the possibility of prison sentences may generate\nfurther animosity against groups such as the RIAA and may be difficult to\ninitiate because of the \"schooling\" effect of millions of systems\nparticipating in file sharing. Only servers would seem to stand out from\nthe crowd.\n\nThe article cites the No Electronic Theft (NET) Act [2], which defines\nillegal  activity and maximum penalties for copyright infringement:\n\n\nCriminal infringement: Any user who infringes a copyright willfully for\npurposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain, or by the\nreproduction or distribution, including by electronic means, during any\n180-day period, of 1 or more copies or phonorecords of 1 or more\ncopyrighted works, which have a total retail value of more than $1,000....\nFor purposes of this subsection, evidence of reproduction or distribution\nof a copyrighted work, by itself, shall not be sufficient to establish\nwillful infringement.\n...\nThe term \"financial gain\" includes receipt, or expectation of receipt, of\nanything of value, including the receipt of other copyrighted works.\n\n\nTherefore, receipt of a work of value would be defined as \"financial gain\"\neven if no money is involved. The NET Act excerpt does not clarify how the\nvalue of a work is determined; an album or movie could be worth only $15\nto millions of dollars depending on whether the value is assessed from the\nperspective of the consumer or copyright holder.\n\nThe statute of limitations:\n\n\n507. Limitations on actions\n\n(a) Criminal Proceedings.--No criminal proceeding shall be maintained\nunder the provisions of this title unless it is commenced within five\nyears after the cause of action arose.\n\n(b) Civil Actions.--No civil action shall be maintained under the\nprovisions of this title unless it is commenced within three years after\nthe claim accrued.\n\nThe penalties are too extensive to list here, but they can be found in\nSection 2319: Criminal infringement of a copyright. In general, first-time\ncriminal offenses will carry a maximum prison sentence of 1 year.\n\nI\u0027m still not sure where the DOJ would start in choosing people to\nprosecute because of the aforementioned \"schooling\" effect, but my guess\nwould be that, just like speeding, primarily the most prominent\nindividuals who operate large servers or transfer the most data will be\ntargeted in order to discourage more recreational file sharers. Thanks to\nMonaLisaOverdrive for pointing out this story.\n\"\n\n[1] http://news.com.com/2100-1023-954591.html?tag\u003dfd_top\n[2] http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/cybercrime/17-18red.htm\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n",

And, I think that:\n\nLooks like a case of \"MY experience is comprehensive, YOUR\u0027S is\nanecdotal, THEY don\u0027t know what they\u0027re talking about\".\n\n\n\u003e1.  The people who pay the wages don\u0027t give a flyin\u0027 heck what programming\n\u003elanguage you write things in... they just want it to work.\n\nIn my experience, they do care.  It has to work certainly, and in\nparticular it has to work with what they\u0027ve already got, and it has to\nwork on client\u0027s systems.\n\nMy limited experience of Java started a few years ago when support on\nLinux was so terrible that I ran away screaming and haven\u0027t come back yet.\n\nMicrosoft has announced that they plan to remove Java from Windows.\nThey took it out of XP already and it has to be installed with a\nservice pack.  Somehow, I can\u0027t imagine them removing the ability to\nrun C programs.\n\n\n\u003e2.  C and C++ forces the developer to solve problems such as memory\n\u003emanagement over and over again.\n\nCan\u0027t say I spend any noticeable amount of time on memory management\nissues, apart from the fact that I frequently need \u003e 4 GB.\n\n\n\u003eIt\u0027s about design patterns, architecture, high level stuff...\n\nIf your problem just requires application of a \"design pattern\" to solve,\nthen it\u0027s trivial anyway irrespective of language.\n\n\n\u003eI am amazed by the amount of time wasted by people talking about low\n\u003elevel problems that have been solved 10 million times over and over\n\u003eand over again...\n\nYou appear to be gratuitously asserting that C programmers waste time\non irrelevant low-level problems and Java programmers don\u0027t.  Depends\nentirely on the programmer, not the language.\n\n\n\u003e3.  Java is not just a programming language! It\u0027s also a platform...\n\nBuzzword.\n\n\n\u003ea monolithic set of API\u0027s or a crap load of different API\u0027s slicing\n\u003eand dicing the same problems 50 different ways?\n\nUnsupported assertion.\n\n\n\u003e4.  If you have a program of any type of high complexity written in C, you\n\u003ecan\u0027t possibly think that you could port it to different platforms within\n\u003ethe same magnitude of cost as Java....\n\nDunno.  E.g., I ported a wee 15000-line C program to Darwin on PowerPC\nin a few minutes yesterday.  Sure if it was badly designed it would be\n10 times the size and harder to port.  If it depended on unavailable\nlibraries it would be much harder.  Portable code is easy to port.\nAt least that is the case when then language you used is available on\nthe target platform: I also run on ARM systems with no proper Java.\n\n\n\u003e5.  Makes no sense for a scientific or a business project to depend on a\n\u003euser... Java, IMHO, reduces the dependence of these entities on the\n\u003eindividual developer as it is much easier to reverse engineer Java as it is\n\u003eto reverse engineer C (large applications).\n\nYou can pay a good programmer to solve your problem now, or else get\nsome kids to hack spaghetti Fortran in any language and then pay for\nmaintenance headaches ad infinitum.\n\n \n\u003e6.  Hardware is getting so fast that I\u0027m not sure if the performance\n\u003edifference between Java and C/C++ are relevant any more.\n\nWhoah!!!  Performance matters to me every day.  (Right now I\u0027m taking\ntime out to write email while waiting for a job to run).  Sure I could\nwait 5 years until everyone\u0027s PC is fast enough to generate random EC\u0027s\nin no time, when any twit will be able to program inefficient code\nthat is fast enough and the market will be overrun by competitors,\nor I can do it now when very few people can.\n\n \n\u003eThe end goal is the scientific or business problem to be solved.\n\nYes.\n\n\n\u003eAnd for those problems, languages such as Java, SmallTalk, and others\n\u003eallow you to think more high level than low level.  Thinking of bits\n\u003eand bytes takes too much gray matter away from the real important\n\u003eproblems....\n\nIt\u0027s true!  I admit everything!  Mea maxima culpa!  Working in C makes\nme spend all day thinking base, rank thoughts about hard-core bitography!\nNot.\n\nActually I spend most of my time thinking in high-level mathematics.\n\n\n\u003eWhy do most computer scientists insist on solving the same problems\n\u003eover and over again [...]\n\nDunno, and frankly I don\u0027t see the relevance to the issue at hand.\n\n\nI\u0027m sure Java is fine for some stuff, as is C or whatever.

When\nthe new academic year begins at UCC, every incoming student will\nbe offered a copy of Red Hat Linux 7.3.\n\nILUG member Braun Brelin proposed this promotion, when he ran a\ntraining class for staff at the UCC computer science department.\nBrelin, who is the director of technology at OpenApp, says that the\nLinux offer could be extended to any or all of the other Irish\nuniversities.\n\nThe user group is tapping into an international Red Hat programme\nthat aims to introduce students at all levels to the open source\nstyle of computing.  The Linux distributor runs an \u0027educational\nchannel\u0027 to reach this audience, bundling educational software\nwith its operating environment and offering networked support\nservices to eligible applicants.  This scheme was originally designed\nto suit the educational structures in the US, but is now available to\nschools and universities throughout the world.\n\nRed Hat Linux 7.3 incorporates ease of use and maintenance\nfeatures and is intended to counter objections that Linux is hard to\nmaster on personal systems.\n\nThe Linux-for-all project at UCC could also raise the profile of Red\nHat Ireland.  Based in Cork, this operation has run shared financial\nservices for other Red Hat offices in Europe since 2000.  Until now\nits involvement with users in Ireland has been fairly limited,\nalthough it does sometimes refer them to other Red Hat offices in\nEurope that offer consulting or technical support services.\n\nDavid Owens, Red Hat\u0027s director of global logistics and production,\nsees the formation of the ILUG marketing group as a reason to take\na more proactive approach.  In the last three months, he notes, his\noffice in Cork has received more and more calls from Irish\ncompanies that are interested in adopting Linux and has introduced\nsome to Red Hat pre-sales consultants.\n\n\n-------------\nMany thanks are due to Braun and David for working together on this one.\n\nRegards\nL.\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users\u0027 Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n",

What would later come to be called South\nAmerica and Central America were surprisingly well-shaped, not only on the\neast coast, where explorers had already sailed, but also on the west coast\n-- which no European was known to have seen.\nThe ice cream cone bulge that sticks out into the Pacific at the junction of\nmodern-day Chile and Peru is readily visible and in almost exactly the right\ngeographical spot -- not only in the main map, but also in an inset printed\nalong its top.\nThe shape of South America in the main map appears distorted because of the\ncurvature of the Earth.\nIt is an improbable coincidence, if it was a coincidence, for the map -- 12\nlarge printed pages to be arrayed in one 36-square-foot wall display -- was\npublished six years before Vasco Balboa\u0027s 1513 trip across the Isthmus of\nPanama and 12 years before Ferdinand Magellan\u0027s 1519-22 trip around the\nworld.\nDid someone get there earlier?\n...\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!

    "message": "\n\u003e\u003eFrom the BBC website - www.bbc.co.uk\n\n Tuesday, 8 October, 2002, 09:43 GMT 10:43 UK \n\n Fake bank website cons victims\n \n West African criminals have used a fake version of a British bank\u0027s online\n service to milk victims of cash, say police. The fake site was used to squeeze\n more money out of people they had already hooked. \n \n The site has been shut down. But UK National Criminal Intelligence Service,\n (NCIS), said at least two Canadians had lost more than $100,000 after being\n taken in by the fake website. \n \n The scam behind the fake web domain was the familiar one that offers people a\n share of the huge sums of money they need moved out of various African\n nations. \n \n NCIS said the use of the web was helping the conmen hook victims that would\n otherwise spot the scam. \n \n Convincing site \n \n News of this latest scam was revealed by BBC Radio5Live. It found that an\n unclaimed web domain of a UK bank had been used by conmen to get more cash out\n their victims. \n\n A NCIS spokesman said the domain looked legitimate because it had \"the\" in\n front of the bank\u0027s name. \n \n \"I have seen the microsite myself and it\u0027s very sophisticated,\" said the NCIS\n spokesman. \"It\u0027s very convincing especially to people not very experienced\n online.\" \n \n Once the con was discovered it was quickly shut down. However, the people\n behind it have not been caught. \n \n NCIS does know that at least two people have lost more than $100,000. \n \n The bank involved has bought up the domain used in the con as well as many\n other permutations of its name to limit the chance it could happen again. \n\n Domain games \n \n Usually people are first hooked in to what has become known as Advanced Fee or\n 419 fraud by replying to an unsolicited fax or e-mail offering a share of any\n cash successfully moved out of Africa. \n \n The \u0027419\u0027 refers to the part of the Nigerian penal code dealing with such\n crimes. \n \n Like any con, there is no money to be moved at all and instead anyone taking\n the bait is asked to pay increasingly large sums to supposedly bribe\n uncooperative officials and to smooth the passage of the cash. \n \n Although this con has been practiced for years, people still fall victim to\n it. \n \n NCIS estimates that up to five Americans are sitting in hotel lobbies in\n London everyday waiting to meet people connected with this con. \n \n Cutting edge fraud \n \n Often the conmen provide fake banking certificates to give the con an air of\n legitimacy. \n \n \n People tricked into clicking on fake sites\n \n But a spokesman for NCIS said fake or spoof websites are now being used in\n place of the certificates. \n \n \"To many people nowadays the cutting edge of banking technology is web\n technology,\" said the spokesman. \n \n One of the first groups of conmen to use this method set up a fake website\n that supposedly gave victims access to accounts held at the South African\n Reserve Bank, the country\u0027s national bank. \n \n Typically, victims are given a login name and password and are encouraged to\n visit the site so they can see that the cash they are getting a share of has\n been deposited in their name. \n \n But before they can get their hands on the cash, the victims are typically\n asked to hand over more of their own money to help the transfer go ahead. \n \n Once the South African police discovered the ruse they declared it a national\n priority crime and soon arrested the 18 people behind it. \n \n Modern gloss \n \n An briefing paper prepared by NCIS in August on organised crime noted that\n criminals were increasingly turning to the web to lure new victims and give\n old cons a modern gloss. \n \n The NCIS spokesman urged people who have fallen victim to 419 fraud to come\n forward and help it track down the perpetrators. He said in the last two\n months it had arrested 24 people overseas involved with this type of fraud. \n \n He said any e-mail, fax or letter making an offer that looks to good too be\n true, undoubtedly is. \n \n One of the first companies to fall victim to website spoofing was net payment\n service Paypal. \n \n Conmen set up a fake site and asked people to visit and re-enter their account\n and credit card details because Paypal had lost the information. \n \n The website link included in the e-mail looked legitimate but in fact directed\n people to a fake domain that gathered details for the conmen\u0027s personal use. \n\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!

The new\narchbishop has repeatedly assured them that he respects the canons of the\nchurch.\nNevertheless, the society said: \"It is clear that he prefers his private\njudgment to the voice of scripture, to the voice of tradition and to the\ncommon mind of the church. As such he can only be a focus of disunity.\n\"The council... called upon loyal Anglicans to pray specifically that Rowan\nWilliams would see the error in his teaching, change his views or stand\ndown,\" it said.\nThe society claimed to have drawn up an \"action plan,\" including calling on\nbishops and primates of the 70 million worldwide Anglican communion, of\nwhich archbishops of Canterbury are the leaders, to distance themselves from\nDr Williams\u0027s doctrinal and ethical position. It promised it would be\n\"taking steps towards appropriate direct action\".\nIt added that Dr Williams remained on the editorial board of a journal\ncalled Theology and Sexuality which, six months ago, published articles\nallegedly commending homosexual behaviour.\nDespite its claim, the society does not represent the common mind of the\nchurch. Dr Williams, currently Archbishop of Wales, was chosen by the crown\nappointments commission of church members, including evangelicals, and his\nappointment was endorsed by the prime minister and the Queen.\nHe is due to succeed George Carey, who retires this month, and will be\nformally enthroned at Canterbury cathedral in February.\nAsked what form direct action might take, the Rev George Curry, the\nsociety\u0027s chairman, said: \"Watch this space.\" Presumably it could involve a\nsmall minority of parishes repudiating the new archbishop and seeking\nalternative oversight or even demonstrations at services where Dr Williams\nis present.\nChurch of England bishops, who have hitherto largely kept their heads down\nduring the row, are meeting next week to discuss their response to the\nevangelical extremists\u0027 challenge, which appears to have grown in the\nabsence of a robust rebuttal.\nA letter by senior theologians in today\u0027s Guardian, however, repudiates the\nevangelicals\u0027 tactics, calling them unseemly and contrary to biblical\nteaching.\nOn the BBC\u0027s Thought for the Day yesterday, Angela Tilby, vice-principal of\nWestcott House, Cambridge, accused Dr Williams\u0027s opponents of presumption\nand blackmail. \"It is in fact a thoroughly aggressive way to behave. It is\nattempting to force an issue by emotional violence... manipulating to get\nyour way is often preferable to painstaking negotiation,\" she said.\nLast week, Dr Williams said he was deeply saddened. \"Matters of sexuality\nshould not have the priority or centrality that Reform and the Church\nSociety have tried to give them. The archbishop cannot withdraw his\nappointment since so many, including evangelicals, have urged him to take\nthe post... the archbishop believes it to be his duty under God.\"\n\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!

But the two new species,\notiorhynchus armadillo and otiorhynchus salicicola, not previously known\nnorth of Switzerland, are now prevalent in south London. \"It\u0027s very likely\nthese weevils have been introduced to Britain through imported ornamental\nplants from Italy,\" said Dr Barclay. \"It looks like they\u0027re here to stay.\"\nHe found otiorhynchus armadillo on the window of a Chelsea department store\nin 1998, but as the shop sold imported house plants, he assumed it was a\nmigrant. It has now quietly become the most common species of vine weevil in\nsouth-west London. The second invader is not so numerous, but has\nestablished itself firmly in the same area.\nApart from laurels, vine weevils attack bay, viburnum, ornamental ivy, and\ngrape vines. An early sign of trouble is that notches appear in leaves. The\nsoil-dwelling larvae bite the roots off below the surface.\nOne possible explanation for the invaders\u0027 successful colonisation of\nBritain is global warming. Earlier springs and milder winters are already a\nfact.\n\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!

The two men pioneered the construction of giant\nunderground chambers to detect neutrinos, elusive particles that stream from\nthe sun by the billion.\nNeutrinos offer an unparalleled view of the sun\u0027s inner workings because\nthey are produced in its heart by the same process that causes it to shine.\nIn fact, Davis\u0027 early experiments, performed during the 1960s in a South\nDakota gold mine, confirmed that the sun is powered by nuclear fusion.\nKoshiba won his share of the prize for his work at the Kamiokande neutrino\ndetector in Japan. That experiment confirmed and extended Davis\u0027 work, and\nalso discovered neutrinos coming from distant supernova explosions, some of\nthe brightest objects in the universe.\nThe Italian-born Giacconi, a U.S. citizen, was awarded half of the prize for\nbuilding the first X-ray telescopes that provided ``completely new - and\nsharp - images of the universe,\u0027\u0027 the academy said.\nHis research laid the foundation for X-ray astronomy, which has led to the\ndiscovery of black holes and allowed researchers to peer deep into the\nhearts of the dusty young galaxies where stars are born.\nWhen academy officials reached Giacconi by phone at his home outside\nWashington, he said he was ``dumbstruck\u0027\u0027 to learn of the prize. Koshiba\nalso was phoned at home in Tokyo, but the academy was still trying to reach\nDavis, spokesman Erling Norrby said.\nThis year\u0027s Nobel awards started Monday with the naming of Britons Sydney\nBrenner, 75, and Sir John E. Sulston, 60, and American H. Robert Horvitz,\n55, as winners of the medicine prize, selected by a committee at the\nKarolinska Institute.\nThe researchers shared it for discoveries about how genes regulate organ\ngrowth and a process of programmed cell deaths that shed light on how\nviruses and bacteria invade human cells, including in conditions such as\nAIDS, strokes, cancer and heart attacks.\nThe winner of the Nobel Prize in chemistry will be named on Wednesday\nmorning and the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of\nAlfred Nobel later the same day.\nThe literature prize winner will be announced on Thursday, the Swedish\nAcademy said on Tuesday.\nThe winner of the coveted peace prize - the only one not awarded in Sweden -\nwill be announced Friday in Oslo, Norway.\nThe award committees make their decisions in deep secrecy and candidates are\nnot publicly revealed for 50 years.\nAlfred Nobel, the wealthy Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite who\nendowed the prizes left only vague guidelines for the selection committees.\nIn his will he said the prize being revealed on Tuesday should be given to\nthose who ``shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind\u0027\u0027 and\n``shall have made the most important discovery or invention within the field\nof physics.\u0027\u0027\nThe Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which also chooses the chemistry and\neconomics winners, invited nominations from previous recipients and experts\nin the fields before cutting down its choices. Deliberations are conducted\nin strict secrecy.\nThe prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel\u0027s death in\n1896, in Stockholm and in Oslo.\n---\nOn the Net:\nNobel site, http://www.nobel.se \n\n------------------------ Yahoo!

In the specific\n\u003e context of software, centralized variables can only contain one valid\n\u003e value at a time.

Nevertheless, centralization is the\n\u003e basis for today?s most popular architectural style for developing\n\u003e network applications: client-server interaction using request-response\n\u003e communication protocols.\n\nI think the ability to maintain an inconsistent database\nis key to decentralization. \n\nDatabases enforce consistenty with every transaction.\nBounded transactions, like an ATM, enforce consistency\n  by have some play with time and value\nMost people keep inconsistent data in their heads, it\u0027s\n  called congnitive dissonance theory\nMost businesses keep inconsistent data, documents, tationale\n  and ideas to support their work activities, it\u0027s called real life.\n\nI don\u0027t think it matters so much where it\u0027s located, i.e.\ndecentralization. I think that decentralization is the workaround\nfrom technical limitations.  The fallout being that the only way\ninconsistent information spaces can be maintained is by \nprotecting them through a set of trust barriers and boundaries. \nThe local information when combined with the technical\ntroubles of providing \"just enough\" forced synchronization\nto remote information provide workable data consistenty, i.e.\nenforcing local constraints or ignoring global ones when\nconcerns are more immedidate.  \n\nTolerating temporary, irreconcilable deviations is how\npeople cope, otherwise you\u0027d be like Nick Gatsby unnecessarily\npre-occupied with a spot of shaving cream on McKee\u0027s neck\nwho thinks that if he can just wipe that spot off that the\nwhole world would be a little more perfect and everything,\nincluding his pre-occupation with Daisy, would consistently\nbe in its proper place.\n\nGreg\n\n",

There are alternative fuel sources,\n\u003eincluding seabed methane, biomass and all the usual suspects -- solar,\n\u003ehydro etc. Some of these could be exploited on a decidedly low-tech (ie,\n\u003eemergent civilization) basis. However, it is difficult to conceive of an\n\u003eindustrial civilization that doesn\u0027t employ wheels, axles and bearings,\n\u003eall of which require lubrication. I\u0027m not an engineer (Robin, anyone?) but\n\u003eit\u0027s my understanding that vegetable lubrication breaks down under stress,\n\u003eand that oil or graphite lubricants are the only reasonable choices for\n\u003ehigh temperature/high rotation applications, at least prior to extremely\n\u003eadvanced modes of chemical synthesis.\n\nThis is a good point. There are a lot of alternatives to hydrocarbon\nproducts derived from petroleum, but these have often been developed as\na replacement for petroleum after the technology has been established -\nthere is a growing industry in plant-derived plastics and lubricants,\nbut this is to replicate materials that have been previously created \nmuch more easily within the petrochemical industry.\n\nVegetable-derived lubricants have been used. The Russians used sunflower\noil in the lubrication systems of tanks and trucks during the second world \nwar, and work is being done in the UK to produce diesel fuel derived from\nwaste cooking oil from fast-food restaurants. \n\nJay\u0027s correct in his opinion that vegetable oil is not as durable as \npetroleum oil, but this is only because of the lack of sophistication \nof the chemistry involved. Synthetic fuels and lubricants are continuously\nbeing developed, and I don\u0027t see any problems with synthetics ultimately \nmatching the performance of the more conventional products. As the rock\noil runs out, plant oil derivatives *will* be developed to fill the\ngap. In parallel, changes will occur in the designs of the machines to \ncope with any changes in performance of the lubricants.\n\nMy big concern is if the technology were ever to be lost for some reason.\nRe-creating a petrochemical industry from scratch without petrochemicals\n(that is, going immediately to plant-based synthetics) would be extremely \ndifficult, especially if it were necessary to recreate *all* of the\npetrochemical-derived products (not just lubricants and fuels). I suspect\nthat, bearing in mind the ingenuity of the human race, it would happen,\njust at a different pace. Imagine an industrial revollution based on,\nfor example, methane from pig manure, or diesel oil from sunflowers.\n\nAll we would then have to do is get used to all the machines smelling\nlike pig farms and fish and chip shops...\n\nRobin Hill, STEAMY BESS, Brough, East Yorkshire\n\n\n\n********************************************************************\nThis email and any attachments are confidential to the intended\nrecipient and may also be privileged.

According\nto the Department for Trade and Industry, the average Briton stands head,\nshoulders, girth and bottoms above their continental partners.\nThe figures come in a new edition of the department\u0027s handbook of\nanthropometric and strength measurements, compiled by ergonomists at the\nUniversity of Nottingham to help manufacturers design products to fit\npeople\u0027s shape.\nThe volume provides 294 measurements ranging from the distance between the\ninner corners of the eyes to the length of the leg between the crease below\nthe buttock to the crease at the back of the knee.\nIt has discovered that the average British man is 36 millimetres (1 inches)\ntaller than his French counterpart.\nThe mean height of UK citizens is 1,755.1mm (5ft 9in). Among European men\nonly the Dutch are taller, averaging 1,795mm and with a clear height\nadvantage over the US men\u0027s average of 1,760.4.\nThe average British woman is 1,620mm tall (just under 5ft 4in), compared\nwith 1,604mm for her French counterpart, 1,610mm for the Italians and\n1,619mm for the Germans. Swedish women average 1,640mm, Dutch 1,650mm and\nAmericans 1,626.7mm\nMore disturbingly, British men and women are heavier than all the other\nnationalities except the Americans, averaging 79.75 kilos for British men\nand 66.7 for women.\nThe average British woman has a chest measurement of 1,007.8mm (39.7\ninches), compared with 965mm for the Italians, 912.6mm for the Japanese and\n806mm for Sri Lankans. American women also top this scale with an average of\n1,047.2mm.\nThe average British woman\u0027s waist is 840.6mm (33 inches) - also second\nlargest behind the Americans. But her bottom at 873.7mm is considerably\nsmaller than the Italians at 916mm who beat the Americans into second place.\nThe average British male foot is 266.8mm long (10.5 inches), 6mm longer than\nthe French and Germans, 3mm more than the Italians and 1mm more than the\nSwedes. But they are just beaten by the Americans at 267.8mm and massively\noutstripped by the Dutch at 275mm.\nHowever Dutch women have daintier feet than the British, averaging 240mm\ncompared with 241.1mm in the UK (9.5 inches). German women average 242mm,\ncompared with 245mm for the Swedes and 242.1mm for the Americans.\nThe DTI has a less than exhaustive record of ring finger lengths, but on the\navailable evidence the British man\u0027s finger at 78.7mm (3.1 inches) is 1.7mm\nlonger than his German counterpart, but 0.2mm shorter than the American\naverage.\nThe British woman\u0027s ring finger at 72.6mm is 0.4mm smaller than her German\ncounterpart and 0.3mm smaller than the American.\nBeverley Norris, research fellow at Nottingham university\u0027s institute for\noccupational ergonomics, said the figures were useful for product designers.\nThe department has recently completed a study of the pulling force needed to\nopen ring pull cans.\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!

Lupa\n did not win, victory going instead to Tartuca, tortoise.\n \n As its supporters erupted into joyous celebrations, Mr Pes was pulled from his\n mount by Istrice members and savagely beaten and kicked for seven minutes.\n \n Mr Pes, 39, whose jacket with his contrada\u0027s colours was torn from his back,\n was sent to hospital with fractures, cuts and bruises.\n \n Three of his attendants who tried to intervene were also beaten. Police\n yesterday arrested six people they said had been identified as the attackers\n from video footage.\n \n Experts said it was the first time that members of a contrada - known as\n contradaioli - had been arrested for beating up a jockey, despite the fact\n that such episodes belong to the race\u0027s ancient traditions.\n \n The Palio, which was first raced in the 14th century, is held twice a year on\n the cobbles of Siena\u0027s main square. For weeks beforehand supporters parade\n through the city, singing, waving flags and wearing their contrada colours.\n But by the day of the race the good humour evaporates.\n \n The event has no rules and is prepared for and run amid an extraordinary\n undercurrent of intrigue and even violence. Jockeys may swap sides at the last\n minute, take bribes, and whip rivals\u0027 horses, and more, so long as they do not\n grab their reins.\n \n The origins of the contrada lie in the Middle Ages, when the neighbourhoods\u0027\n boundaries were set out to aid the many mercenary companies hired to defend\n Siena\u0027s fiercely earned independence from Florence and other city states.\n \n The first Palio of the year takes place on July 2, to commemorate the miracles\n of the Madonna of Provenzano, and a second race on Aug 16 marks the feast of\n the Assumption of the Virgin.\n\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!

    "message": "\nhttp://media.guardian.co.uk/broadcast/comment/0,7493,781769,00.html\n\nHamza\u0027s horrid - but we must tolerate him\n\nRod Liddle\nWednesday August 28, 2002\nThe Guardian\n\nSheikh Abu Hamza al-Masri, our maddest of mad mullahs and a cartoon bogeyman\nto scare the kiddies, spent a quiet and contemplative bank holiday playing\nwith his own children in Victoria Park, Hackney.\nI\u0027ve often wondered what incendiary Islamic fundamentalist clerics do on\nstatutory public holidays. Head for the beach and maybe swing by B\u0026Q on the\nway home, I had hoped. I had this beguiling vision of Hamza paddling in the\nsea, an ice-cream cone in his one good hand, the waves tickling his shins,\nand the sheikh mentally preparing to fix those pesky shelves in the kitchen\nfor once, instead of planning the extermination of Zionism and America and\nmaybe me and you, too.\nBut B\u0026Q and a day at the seaside is probably beyond Hamza\u0027s budget since the\nBank of England froze his assets, so Victoria Park had to do. But he sounded\nhappy enough when I spoke to him, with the babble of tiny, cheerful, Islamic\nproto-warriors in the background.\nYou must know Hamza; he\u0027s the imam designed, it would seem, by the Daily\nMail\u0027s cartoonist Mac. Large metal hook in place of a left hand. One eye\ncovered by a patch, the other a baleful, watchful, milky-white. We don\u0027t\nmock the disabled any more these days, unless it\u0027s someone like Hamza whom\nwe don\u0027t like; then, if you\u0027ll excuse the inapt phraseology, the gloves come\noff. So Hamza is known (with that vaulting imagination typical of the\nBritish right) as \"Captain Hook\", in articles which usually call for his\narrest, or extradition to the US, or deportation back home to Egypt or maybe\noff to Pakistan or Afghanistan, where he fought the Russians for years and\nthus sustained his disabilities - anywhere, really; just out of here. And if\nwe can\u0027t lock him up or chuck him out of the country, maybe we can force him\nto shut up.\nBecause we don\u0027t like Hamza very much. We weren\u0027t that fond of him before\nSeptember 11, but afterwards, in that nervy, paranoid few months when we all\nthought the sky might fall in, our disapprobation turned into political\npersecution.\nAnd now the Daily Mirror is agitating again for his arrest because they\u0027ve\ngot hold of secret videos of the man behaving in an even more inflammatory\nmanner, urging warfare on and looting of enemies of Islam. All out of\ncontext, and a very long time ago, says the imam, not unduly bothered. But\nperhaps he should be, because our reputation for broad-mindedness and\ntolerance towards people like Hamza was thinning even before the Mirror\u0027s\nscoop.\nHamza preaches, or preached, at the scary Finsbury Park Mosque - so, earlier\nthis year, the Charity Commissioners banned him from doing so because of his\nallegedly inflammatory remarks. I didn\u0027t know Charity Commissioners were\nmeant to do stuff like that.\nHe has had his passport seized and not returned; his assets have been\nfrozen. He is tailed by the police every now and then, and his access to the\nmedia is restricted by internal policing within broadcasting corporations\nand the press. And this last point is because, we tell ourselves, endlessly\n- repeating the mantra over and over again, and fervently wishing it to be\ntrue - Hamza is not \"representative\" of British Muslims, as if British\nMuslims were a simple, homogenous thing with a single voice that one could\nturn to every now and then for explanation. And perhaps succour.\nThe trouble is, in the first month or so after the twin towers attack he was\nrevealed to be rather more \"representative\" than the list of those\ngovernment-approved Muslim spokesmen who were - uncomfortably, I suspect -\ndragooned briefly into statements of support for the war against terrorism\nand a blanket condemnation of the Taliban.\nAn opinion poll commissioned by Radio 4\u0027s Today programme revealed that an\noverwhelming majority of British Muslims were against George Bush\u0027s crusade.\nOne in six were, to put it mildly, ambivalent about the attack on the US\n(the remainder condemned the attack unequivocally). A large majority thought\nthe war against terrorism was a war against Islam.\nWhich is what Hamza said, repeatedly. But it was something that, at the\ntime, we didn\u0027t want to hear. Now, if you quiz the man on present policy at\nhome and abroad he comes across - superficially, at least - as someone from\nthe liberal left. No war against Iraq; Britain to become independent of US\nforeign policy and attempt rapprochement with Arab states; stronger action\nagainst Israel; mistrust of global capitalism; redistribution of wealth.\nNor is he particularly anti-semitic, so far as I can tell, although I don\u0027t\nsuppose he will be holidaying in Eilat this year. In yesterday\u0027s Guardian,\nthe chief rabbi expressed a willingness to talk to Hamza and was grateful\nfor the sheikh\u0027s message of condolence when a London synagogue was attacked.\nWhich is not to say that Hamza is a peaceable Jeffersonian democrat who has\nbeen wilfully misrepresented: he is, without question, rather more\ninflammatory in private sermons to his own people than he is in public. His\nideology is an arid and uncompromising interpretation of Islam: he would be\nhappy, in a truly Islamic society, to stone women to death for adultery, for\nexample. You and I would find many - perhaps most - of his views utterly\nrepellent.\nAnd that\u0027s the point. Because Hamza is the true test of our apparent desire\nto be multicultural. Multiculturalism is not, surely, the cheerful\nappropriation of bits of inoffensive minority cultural behaviour by the\nruling hegemony. That is a sort of syncopated monoculturalism.\nMulticulturalism is, rather, the ability of society to tolerate views that\nare antithetical to the dominant culture - and maybe learn from them.\nThe FBI has been investigating Hamza, but, of course, has found nothing\nremotely incriminating. The real reason for his vilification and persecution\nis simply the pungency of his views.\nIt is often said that we should shut him up or arrest him because his\nrhetoric increases hostility against the Muslim population generally. This\nis a perfectly noble argument, but it does not wash.\nYou don\u0027t defuse a difficult situation by pretending it doesn\u0027t exist. And\nif British Muslims - maybe a minority, maybe not - feel a growing sense of\nunease or mystification at the direction of western foreign policy, it is\nnot because they have been led in that direction by Hamza. Shutting the man\nup, therefore, won\u0027t make a difference.\nIt is rather as Louis MacNeice had it:\nThe glass is falling hour by hour, the glass will fall for ever.\nBut if you break the bloody glass, you won\u0027t hold up the weather.\n\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!

As usual the result is\nthat I\u0027ve spent much more time repackaging the darn thing than actually\ntesting the functionalities or trying to hear the great sound quality\npeople seem to think it outputs... but hey, some of you will benefit from\nthat, right? ;-)\n\nI\u0027ve got the whole thing working on a Valhalla system, but the packages\nshould easily install or at least recompile on Enigma, Limbo/(null) and\nmaybe others, who knows ;-)\n\nHere are quick instructions for those of you that wish to try it out :\n- Recompile the \"alsa-driver\" source rpm for your running kernel\n  (you can install the binary package if you\u0027re using the i686 2.4.18-10)\n- Install this \"alsa-driver\" package\n- Install the \"alsa-libs\" package\n- Install the \"alsa-utils\" package\n\nNow go to this URL and find out what you need to change in your\n/etc/modules.conf file to replace the default OSS driver loading :\nhttp://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/\n(very complete and very good documentation!)\nHopefully you\u0027ll see that your card *is* supported ;-)\n\nReboot, or remove by hand your current sound modules (you\u0027ll probably need\nto stop many applications to free the sound resource...) \"by hand\" and\ninsert the new ones. If all is well you\u0027ve got ALSA working! (\"dmesg\" to\ncheck is a good idea), you now just need to adjust the volume levels with\ne.g. aumix and alsamixer because everything is muted by default.\n\nWith \"aplay\" you can already test files to see if you hear anything. You\ncan also install the XMMS plugin (seems to make my XMMS segfault on exit...\nhmmm, but maybe it\u0027s another plugin) to listen to your good ol\u0027 mp3\nfiles... that\u0027s it!\n\nIt really isn\u0027t complicated, and has never been from what I see. The only\nthing I disliked was to have to install from source... but as I can\u0027t\nimagine myself doing that ;-) I\u0027ve repackaged everything cleanly. Even the\n/dev entries are included in the rpm package (and *not* created by an ugly\n%post script, I insist!) and seamlessly integrate into the /etc/makedev.d\nstructure. There are also a few other noticeable differences with the\ndefault provided ALSA spec files, for example I\u0027ve split alsa-lib\u0027s\ndevelopment files into an alsa-lib-devel package and included static\nlibraries... there are others of course (oh yes, the kernel version against\nwhich the \"alsa-driver\" package is compiled gets neatly integrated in the\nrpm release, so does the architecture!).\n\nI\u0027m open to any comments or suggestions about these packages!\n\nDownload :\nhttp://ftp.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/testing/alsa/\n\nCurrent spec files :\nhttp://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-driver/alsa-driver.spec\nhttp://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-lib/alsa-lib.spec\nhttp://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-utils/alsa-utils.spec\n(All others, patches etc. : http://freshrpms.net/builds/ )\n\nMatthias\n\nPS: As an extra bonus, I\u0027ve also recompiled xine with alsa support!

    "message": "\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/americas/08/26/peru.mother.reut/index.html\n\nLIMA, Peru (Reuters) -- Lina Medina\u0027s parents thought their 5-year-old daughter had a huge abdominal tumor and when shamans in their remote village in Peru\u0027s Andes could find no cure, her father carried her to hospital. \n\nJust over a month later, she gave birth to a boy. \n\nAged 5 years, seven months and 21 days old when her child was born by Caesarean section in May 1939, Medina made medical history, and is still the youngest known mother in the world. \n\nAt the time, Peru\u0027s government promised aid that never materialized. Six decades on, Medina lives with her husband in a cramped house in a poor, crime-ridden district of the Peruvian capital known as \"Little Chicago.\" \n\nNow 68, she keeps herself to herself and has long refused requests to rake up the past. Gerardo, the son she delivered while still a child herself, died in 1979 at the age of 40. \n\nBut a new book, written by an obstetrician who has been interested in her case, has drawn fresh attention to Medina\u0027s story, and raised the prospect that the Peruvian government may belatedly offer her financial and other assistance. \n\n\"The government condemned them to live in poverty. In any other country, they would be the objects of special care,\" Jose Sandoval, author of \"Mother Aged 5,\" told Reuters. \n\n\"We still have time to repair the damage done to her. That\u0027s my fundamental objective,\" he added. \n\n\u0027Totally willing to help\u0027\nSandoval has raised Medina\u0027s case with the office of first lady Eliane Karp, and has asked the government to grant her a life pension -- something officials say is possible. \n\n\"We\u0027re totally willing to help her,\" said spokeswoman Marta Castaneda. But Suni Ramos, of the social action department of Karp\u0027s office, said that before the government could grant her a pension or any other of the aid it was already planning -- such as kitchen and other household equipment -- it needed to talk to her to discuss what she wanted and needed. It is currently trying to contact Medina and her family. \n\nMedina\u0027s husband, Raul Jurado, told Reuters his wife remained skeptical. \"She got no help (in 1939) that I know about,\" he said. \"She thinks governments never deliver. Maybe today there will be a promise that will never come true.\" \n\nJurado said his wife, whose story is a medical textbook classic and whose case is confirmed as true by such bodies as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, had turned down Reuters\u0027 request for an interview. \n\nMedical rarity\nNo one has ever established who was the father of Medina\u0027s child, or confirmed she became pregnant after being raped. \n\nOne of nine children born to country folk in Ticrapo, an Andean village at an altitude of 7,400 feet (2,250 meters) in Peru\u0027s poorest province, Medina is believed to be the youngest case of precocious puberty in history, Sandoval said. \n\nHe said she had her first period at 2 1/2, became pregnant aged 4 years and eight months and that when doctors performed the Caesarean to deliver her baby, they found she already had fully mature sexual organs. \n\nHer swelling stomach worried her parents. \"They thought it was a tumor,\" he said. But shamans ruled out village superstitions -- including one in which locals believed a snake grew inside a user until it killed them -- and recommended they take her to hospital in the nearest big town, Pisco.\n\nThere came the staggering diagnosis that she was pregnant. \n\nHer father was jailed temporarily on suspicion of incest -- he was later released for lack of evidence -- and doctors, police and even a film crew set off for her village for preliminary investigations into her case. \n\nSandoval, who based his book on media and other published information, and some interviews with relatives as Medina herself declined to comment, said news of the child mother-to-be drew instant offers of aid, including one worth $5,000 from a U.S. businessman, which was turned down. \n\nMore offers followed after Medina was transferred to a Lima hospital, where her fully developed 6-pound (2.7 kg) baby was born on May 14, 1939 -- Mother\u0027s Day. \n\nOne offer was worth $1,000 a week, plus expenses, for Medina and her baby to be exhibited at the World\u0027s Fair in New York. Another, from a U.S. business that the family accepted in early June 1939, was for the pair to travel to the United States for scientists to study the case. The offer included setting up a fund to ensure their lifelong financial comfort. \n\nBut within days, the state trumped all previous offers, decreeing that Medina and her baby were in \"moral danger,\" and resolving to set up a special commission to protect them. \n\nBut Sandoval said: \"It abandoned the case after six months ...It did absolutely nothing for them.\" \n\nHappy ending?\nThough physically mature, Medina -- who Sandoval said was mentally normal and showed no other unusual medical symptoms -- still behaved like a child, preferring to play with her dolls instead of the new baby, who was fed by a wet nurse. \n\nMedina stayed in hospital for 11 months, finally returning to her family after it began legal proceedings that led to a Supreme Court ruling allowing her to live with them again. \n\nAfter taunting from schoolmates, Gerardo -- who was named after one of the doctors who attended Medina and became their mentor -- discovered when he was 10 that the woman he had grown up believing to be his sister was in fact his mother. \n\nHe died in 1979 from a disease that attacks the body\u0027s bone marrow, but Sandoval said it was not clear there was any link with his illness and the fact his mother had been so young. \n\nMedina married and in 1972 had a second son, 33 years after her first. Her second child now lives in Mexico. \n\nShe appears to have turned her bizarre story into a taboo subject. \"We just want to get on with our lives, that\u0027s it,\" said Jurado, adding he thought \"absolutely nothing\" of the fact his wife was the world\u0027s youngest mother. \n\nHe said the couple\u0027s main concern now, if the government\u0027s offer of aid was genuine, was to be granted the value of a property that belonged to Medina and which the then-government expropriated more than two decades ago. That house has now been destroyed and there is a road on the site. \n\nHe said its value was \"more or less $25,000\" and settling the property question would conclude a long legal battle to get back a home of their own -- they live now in a modest house, accessed down a dingy alley half blocked by a wooden board, in a tough neighborhood known to locals as a thieves\u0027 paradise. \n\n\"If the government really wants to help...they should give us the value of our property,\" he said. \n\nAs for Sandoval, he said he was optimistic that Medina\u0027s story, which he has studied since his student days, would turn out well. \"I believe there will be a happy ending,\" he said. \n\n\"As a result of the war, corporations have now been enthroned and an era\nof corruption in high places will follow and the money-power of the\ncountry will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the\nprejudices of the people until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands\nand the Republic is destroyed.\"\nAbraham Lincoln (Nov 21, 1864 in a letter to Col. William F Elkins)\n\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!

A proposed law based on the discussion \ndraft is expected to be introduced in Parliament late this year or in \nearly 2003.\n\nArguing that more and more communications take place in electronic form, \nCanadian officials say such laws are necessary to fight terrorism and \ncombat even run-of-the-mill crimes. They also claim that by enacting \nthese proposals, Canada will be following its obligations under the \nCouncil of Europe\u0027s cybercrime treaty \n\u003chttp://news.com.com/2100-1001-268894.html\u003e, which the country is in the \nprocess of considering.\n\nIf the discussion draft were to become law, it would outlaw the \npossession of computer viruses, authorize police to order Internet \nproviders to retain logs of all Web browsing for up to six months, and \npermit police to obtain a search warrant allowing them to find \"hidden \nelectronic and digital devices\" that a suspect might be concealing. In \nmost circumstances, a court order would be required for government \nagents to conduct Internet monitoring.\n\nCanada and the United States are nonvoting members of the Council of \nEurope, and representatives from both countries\u0027 police agencies have \nendorsed the controversial cybercrime treaty \n\u003chttp://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/CadreListeTraites.htm\u003e, which has \ndrawn protests from human rights activists and civil liberties groups. \nOf nearly 50 participating nations, only Albania has formally adopted \n\u003chttp://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/searchsig.asp?NT\u003d185\u0026CM\u003d8\u0026DF\u003d27/08/02\u003e, \nor ratified, the treaty.\n\nMichael Geist \u003chttp://aix1.uottawa.ca/%7Egeist/\u003e, a professor at the \nUniversity of Ottawa who specializes in e-commerce law, says that the \njustification for adopting such sweeping changes to Canadian law seems \nweak.\n\n\"It seems to me that the main justification they\u0027ve given for all the \nchanges is that we want to ratify the cybercrime treaty and we need to \nmake changes,\" Geist said. \"To me that\u0027s not a particularly convincing \nargument. If there are new powers needed for law enforcement authority, \nmake that case.\"\n\nGeist added that \"there\u0027s nothing in the document that indicates (new \npowers) are needed. I don\u0027t know that there have been a significant \nnumber of cases where police have run into problems.\"\n\nProbably the most sweeping change the legal blueprint contemplates is \ncompelling Internet providers and telephone companies to reconfigure \ntheir networks to facilitate government eavesdropping and data-retention \norders. The United States has a similar requirement, called the \nCommunications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act \n\u003chttp://www.epic.org/privacy/wiretap/calea/calea_law.html\u003e, but it \napplies only to pre-Internet telecommunications companies.\n\n\"It is proposed that all service providers (wireless, wireline and \nInternet) be required to ensure that their systems have the technical \ncapability to provide lawful access to law enforcement and national \nsecurity agencies,\" according to the proposal. Companies would be \nresponsible for paying the costs of buying new equipment.\n\nSarah Andrews, an analyst at the Electronic Privacy Information Center \n\u003chttp://www.epic.org/\u003e (EPIC) who specializes in international law, says \nthe proposal goes beyond what the cybercrime treaty specifies. \"Their \nproposal for intercept capability talks about all service providers, not \njust Internet providers,\" Andrews said. \"The cybercrime treaty deals \nonly with computer data.\" EPIC opposes \n\u003chttp://www.privacyinternational.org/issues/cybercrime/coe/ngo_letter_601.htm\u003e \nthe cybercrime treaty, saying it grants too much power to police and \ndoes not adequately respect privacy rights.\n\nAnother section of the proposal says the Canadian Association of Chiefs \nof Police recommends \"the establishment of a national database\" with \npersonal information about all Canadian Internet users. \"The \nimplementation of such a database would presuppose that service \nproviders are compelled to provide accurate and current information,\" \nthe draft says.\n\nGus Hosein, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics and an \nactivist with Privacy International, calls the database \"a dumb idea.\"\n\n\"Immediately you have to wonder if you\u0027re allowed to use anonymous \nmobile phones or whether you\u0027re allowed to connect to the Internet \nanonymously,\" Hosein said.\n\nA representative for George Radwanski \n\u003chttp://www.privcom.gc.ca/au_e.asp\u003e, Canada\u0027s privacy commissioner, said \nthe office is reviewing the blueprint and does not \"have any comments on \nthe paper as it stands.\"\n\nComments on the proposal can be sent to la-al@justice.gc.ca \n\u003cmailto:la-al@justice.gc.ca\u003e no later than Nov. 15.\n\n\n\n",

Researchers had feared that a breakaway iceberg the size of Jamaica\n had all but wiped out the colony at Cape Crozier on Ross Island. \n \n Thousands of chicks are believed to have died as an increase in sea ice made\n it impossible for the adults to find food. A detailed count is planned in\n October. Antarctica (New Zealand) chief executive Lou Sanson said: \"The\n penguins were in a big huddle. We can now hope that the emperors have had a\n successful breeding season over the winter.\" \n \n Some 1,000 pairs of emperors - the largest penguins in the world at 3.3ft tall\n and 88lb - usually nest at Cape Crozier, 50 miles from the US McMurdo research\n station. The 200,000-strong Adelie penguin colony, which also nests at the\n cape, may have lost up to third of its population. \n\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!

The written words are then translated\ninto English and read out by a speech synthesizer. \n\n\"It went reasonably well half the time,\" said Mr Frederking, though it was\nslow in translating phrases. \n\nThe research team admit that the system is not ready to be deployed in the\nfield. \n\nBut they say their trials showed that a portable translator could be made to\nwork with further research and development. \n\nThe Audio Voice Translation Guide System project was a joint venture between\nthe US Army, the military manufacturer Lockheed Martin and Carnegie Mellon\nUniversity. \n\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!

In Zimbabwe which was once the bread basket of the\nregion, some six million people are estimated to need food aid.\nThe WFP says it already has aid pledges for about half of the 600,000 tonnes\nof food it intends to bring into Zimbabwe in the next few months.\nThe government blames the shortages solely on drought, but the government\u0027s\ncampaign to transfer land from large scale commercial white farmers has\nworsened the situation, say many donors.\nLost markets\nThe GM row has complicated relief efforts across the region.\nZambia\u0027s president is refusing to overturn his ban on GM food aid, labelling\nit as \u0027poison\u0027 .\nDeals to mill GM food before being distributed, so that it could not be\nplanted, have placated fears in Malawi and Mozambique.\nUnited States aid officials deny that the food is unsafe, pointing out that\nAmericans eat GM maize every day.\nThe World Health Organisation has certified the grain for human consumption\nand says it does not constitute a danger to people\u0027s health.\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!

I\u0027m not a C programmer,\nbut I think that these sort of things (#include \u003cblahblah\u003e) are\ninstructions to the compiler processed by a pre-processor in the compile\nprocess, and include all sorts of symbols/functions\ne.g. \"#include \u003cmath.h\u003e\" gives you maths type functions.  Since they\nstart with \"#\" they are ignored in the final compilation.\n\nRegarding the rest of the compile process, you need to tell the PCtel\nsoftware to look in the right place for the kernel headers/source. \nI recall from your previous mail that there was a flag\n    --with-kernel-includes\u003d/usr/src/linux-2.4\nwhich could be passed to the ./configure script (with the appropriate\ndirectory in place of /usr/src/linux-2.4).  This might allow you to\npersuade the code to compile against the correct headers.  I think this\nis the right way to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the steps above regarding \"make dep\" and so forth\nshould have been performed in the directory where the make process is\nlooking for modversions.h \u0026 Co.\n\nI don\u0027t think it is a good idea keep moving files into the directory as\nyou describe below.  First of all you will move modversions.h (which you\nhave done), then you would have to move all those *.ver files, after\nthat, there will almost certainly be a need for further header (*.h)\nfiles.  This could be quickly done, but is probably bad (those files\ndon\u0027t really belong there).\n\nFor what it\u0027s worth I think you are very close to a successful\ncompilation.\n\nm\n\n\u003e \n\u003e Also, when I was in the pctel directory and typed \"make\", I noticed\n\u003e that a different subdirectory is taken to a different modversions.h\n\u003e file.

We stood beside each other through the darkest days of the\nCold War as partners in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. We\ncelebrated with them over the fall of the Soviet Empire and the liberation\nof Eastern Europe from the yoke of communism.\n\nTragically, a generation from now, we may be bitter adversaries.\n\nEurope has increasingly fallen under the spell of a political ideology that\nHudson Institute scholar John Fonte has termed \"progressive\ntransnationalism\". The key doctrines of this form of post-communist\nprogressivism contain some fairly pernicious ideas. Among these are the\ndeconstruction of nationalism, the promotion of post-nationalist ideas of\ncitizenship (i.e. a \"global\" citizenry), a redefinition of democracy, and\nthe pooling of national sovereignty into multinational groups such as the\nUnited Nations.\n\nThe European Union, itself a multinational organization built through the\npooling of sovereignty by European nations, is post-democratic. While there\nis a European Parliament, the EU\u0027s power resides mainly in the unelected\nEuropean Commission (EC) and its unelected President, who face few limits\nto their power. Instead of a limited, consensual form of government, where\nelected representatives promulgate constitutional laws, the EU has an\nappointed, oligarchic executive, along with a large attendant bureaucracy,\nwhose orders are not constitutionally limited in any real sense. Moreover,\nthe EU has been unwilling to accept the democratically expressed wishes of\nthe people themselves when those wishes conflict with the results desired\nby the EU\u0027s political elite. Both the EC and the European Court of Justice\nregularly overturn the national laws of democratically elected EU member\ngovernments. This is a step backward in Europe\u0027s political development.\n\nEuropean criticism of America is on the rise, and the European list of\ncomplaints about America is a long and growing one. They dislike the fact\nthat our republican system of government is not based on proportional\nrepresentation. They hate the fact that our citizens own guns. They despise\nthe fact that we execute murderers. They resent the fact that our economy\nis so large, and that Americans consume so much. They also resent?and fear\n- the fact that we have the ability to project American power anywhere\nin the world.\n\nOn August 9, 2002, Adrian Hamilton wrote a column in the UK\u0027s Independent\nnewspaper, in which he identified the US as a rogue state who should be\nrestrained, perhaps by a European military invasion, followed by a decade\nor so of occupation. Fortunately, the article is satirical not because it\nexaggerates the way European progressives view the US, but rather because\nthe impotence of European military power makes the idea of an invasion of\nthe US literally fantastic.\n\nAt least, for now.\n\nDespite the tongue-in-cheek nature of this editorial, however, the fact\nremains that America is increasingly viewed this way by the European\nintellectual and political elite.\n\nThe Europeans actively desire a world where the United Nations keeps in\ncheck the activities of sovereign states. Because they have built such a\nsystem in Europe, they feel it\u0027s valid for the rest of the world. America,\nhowever, is the biggest obstacle to such a system. The Europeans cannot\nunderstand why America places a higher value on the ethos of national\nsovereignty and limited, consensual, and constitutional government, than it\ndoes on compliance with international \"norms.\" They view all departures\nfrom such norms as aberrant. Because the UN member states all have an equal\nvote in prescribing international norms, they assume that, since the\nprocess is ostensibly legitimate, the results must be as well. The trouble\nwith this idea, of course, is that it gives the views of non-democratic,\nauthoritarian states the same weight as those of free, democratic\nsocieties. It sanctifies the process, with no regard to the actual results.\n\nThus, they are unable to make any moral distinction between the US refusals\nto join in a given international effort because we wish to preserve the\nliberty of our citizens, and similar refusals from Iraq because its\ndictator wishes to maintain his firm grip on power. Our repeated references\nto the US Constitution, and our unwillingness to bypass its provisions to\ncomply with international norms, are incomprehensible to them. They assume,\ntherefore, that our refusal is based on arrogance, rather than on a\ncommitment to\nconstitutional rights.\n\nNone of this bodes well for the future of Euro-American friendship, or\ncooperation. If the Europeans continue to reject traditional liberalism in\nfavor of the new progressivism, their criticism of the US will rise, while\ntheir tolerance of our differences will fall. Obviously, in such a\npolitical atmosphere, the opportunities for conflict will inevitably\nincrease.\n\nThat thought is frightening enough. Even more frightening, however, is the\nthought that such a conflict might be averted by our own acceptance of the\nnew ideology of transnational progressivism.\n\n\n-- \n-----------------\nR. A.

    "message": "\n\n\nI have translated the article in full - see \nend of post (I think that I\u0027ve done a far \nbetter job than the Google translation - at \nleast it\u0027s readable now - any corrections\nappreciated).\n\nStuff in {}\u0027s is my (and others) additions \nto the debate.\n\nMy apologies if I\u0027ve paraphrased anybody \nincorrectly, I will be glad to retract if \nanyone is miffed.\n\n\n\nThe article makes four main points.\n\n\n1) Absence of critical clauses. \n\n\nIn this case, the idea is that the licence \nis invalid because it doesn\u0027t specify\nunder what country\u0027s law the GPL is governed.\n\n\n2) Specification in English only.\n\nThat for the end user (as opposed to businesses), \nthe GPL doesn\u0027t apply because it\u0027s not written \nin French.\n\n\n3) Arbitary licence change.\n\nThe point here is that (under French law) the \nauthor can change the terms of the licence \narbitarily. This is because any granting of \nrights by an author must be clearly delimited\nin terms of how long, where, to whom, dates and \ntimes. In the absence of such limitations, the \noriginal author has the right to change his \nsoftware back to closed on a whim.\n\n\n{\n\nDavid Neary makes the point that the copyright \nholder automatically retains the right to change \nthe licence.\n\nScott replies it simply requires authorisation from \nall *copyright holders*\n\nThat\u0027s not my understanding. French law allows a \nGPL type licence *_on condition_* that the \nspecific conditions of the granting of such\nrights are clear - if they are not, there is\nnothing to stop the original author taking\nback \"his work\". The lawyers see this\n(correctly IMHO) as a weakness in the GPL).\n\n}\n\n\n\n4) Hidden defects.\n\nRoughly, this clause means that the author(s) \nis/are liable for any defects if the consumer \nis not an IT engineer, so if Linux blows up \nand data is lost, then the authors are liable.\n\n\n{\n\nCiaran Johnson says that M$oft and others have \nsimilar clauses - the point here is that they \nare *_all_* invalid - just that this one \naffects the GPL also.\n\nNiall O\u0027Broinn makes the point that it is not\na sale, but rather a service/leasing arrangement\nand that\u0027s why it doesn\u0027t come under this point.\n\nI would suggest that the whole thrust of this\narticle has been to see software \"sales\" (even\nif no money changes hands) as governed very\nmuch by consumer law (in France anyway).\n\n\nRick Moen makes the point that it is not\na sale but rather a granting of rights which\nare not default. \n\nSee the bit about even the granting of \nrights by an author having to be \nexplicitly specified - under French law.\n\n\nThe fact that two IP lawyers in France think that\nthe GPL is covered as a sale make me feel that \nthere is a de facto sale and a de facto contract.\n\n}\n\n\n\n5) Roughly.\n\nThere may be other reasons under French \nlaw why the  GPL may be invalid.\n\n\n\n-----  Whole Article. -----------\n\n\nFreedom(a) is worth more than these \nimperfect licences.\n\n\nSpecialised lawyers look at the GPL.\n\n\n\nLawyer Cyril Rojinsky (duly appointed to \nthe court) and the jurist Vincent Grynbaum, both \nspecialised in the area of intellectual property \nexamine the \"free\" licences and in particular the \nGPL. They have published their study\nin the review \"Proprietes intellectuelles \n(Intellectual property)[1]\" and their\nconclusion is grim.\n\n\nTheir approach is interesting. The problem for \nthem is not to know whether freedom is valid under \nFrench law (for them the question is a moot point)\nbut rather they asked themselves about the form \nand the content of the text of free licences, and \nin particular the GPL. The problem is not free \nprogrammes, but rather the licence contracts of \nfree programmes.\n\n\n\nAbsence of critical clauses.\n\n\n\nThe authors tell us that first of all, the \nreference to \"copyright\" is not legally \nsufficient in the framework of international \ncontracts  (which is the case of licence \ncontracts for programmes developed and spread \nvia the Internet). The idea of copyright can \nbasically include differences from one country \nto another. This is why, under international \ncontracts, it is necessary to specify to which \nlaws one is referring (French law, American \u0026c.).\n\nThe authors only found three public licences \nwhich were correctly formulated on this point: \nQPL, IBM Public Licence and the Mozilla Public\nLicence).\n\n\n\nSpecification in the English language.\n\n\n\nNext, the authors remind us that (at least in \nFrance), no clause in a contract may be contrary \nto French law [2]. However, it turns out that a \nlicence such as the GPL is contrary to French law \nin several respects. Firstly, it is written in \nEnglish and the FSF doesn\u0027t officially approve \ntranslations. \n\nThe \"Toubon law\" obliges this sort \nof contract to be written in French, including for \nbusinesses since the notion of \"user\" applies not \nonly to consumers, but also to businesses, \nprofessionals \u0026c. \n\n\nContacted by the editors of LinuxFrench, \nlawyer Cyril Rojinsky declared that, as \nfar as business is concerned, the \"Toubon \nlaw\" is probably doomed to change since \nit is in contradiction of European directives \non the subject, but whatever about that, the \nproblem is still valid for individuals, and \nwhile waiting for it (French law) to change, \nFrench companies have to deal with it, since \nit is the law of the land.\n\n\nA programme under the GPL can suddenly \nchange licence.\n\n\nAnother problem, much more serious, is \nthat according to French law, the author of \na free programme can, at any time, invoke \nthe invalidity of the licence for this \nsoftware by simply changing the licence.\n\n\nIn effect, the law of intellectual \nproperty stipulates that the granting of  \nrights by the author is subordinate to \nthe condition that each of these granted \nrights be the object of a distinct clause \nin the granting act (i.e. the licence) and \nthat the granting of any such rights be \ndelimited with respect to its scope and its \ngrantees, and also with respect to its \nlocation (i.e. where such rights may be \nexcersised)  and duration of any such grants. \n[3] This is not the case of the GPL nor of\nother free licences. Briefly, this means \nthat in France, or elsewhere if the author \nis French, that which is under the GPL could \nrevert to proprietary from one day to the next. \n \n\n\nThe problem of the guarantee \"hidden defects\".\n\n\nAn other very serious flaw is that of the \nguarantee. The GPL licences and others show \nthat the software is delivered \"without \nguarantee\". You are going to immediately\nreply that commercical programmes carry the \nsame clause in their licence contracts,\nand this is correct. However, whatever is \nwritten in a licence contract, one cannot\nfree oneself from the \"guarantee from \nhidden defects\", since it is imposed in the \nCivil Code. This concept is poorly understood \nby the layman, it protects the buyer\n(whoever it may be, individual or business, \nsince it specifies the Civil Code and not \nconsumer protection law) against hidden \ndefects, deliberate or made in good faith by \nthe seller. \n\n\nFor example, if one buys a pair of socks \nin a sale, and the shop has a notice \nspecifying that \"Sale items are neither \nrefunded nor exchanged\", and on arriving \nhome you notice that one of the socks has \na hole in it, several scenarios are possible.\n\n\nYou could have checked the socks before \npurchase: the flaw is deemed \"obvious\" and\nyou can sing for your money.\n\n\nYou couldn\u0027t check the socks (they were \npackaged for example), and in this case, \ndespite the notice \"neither refund nor \nexchange\", you may invoke \"hidden defect\" \nand have them changed or obtain a refund, \nit\u0027s up to you. \n\nPersonally, I have already invoked in shops \nthe \"hidden defect\" clause and it always \nworked well (shopkeepers are always very \ncooperative if you quote a couple of words \nof the Civil Code). \n\n\nThe concept of hidden defect is rather \nwide, it is necessary that you hadn\u0027t \nthe possibility of discovering the defect \nbefore buying the product and then \n(according to the Civil Code) that you \nwouldn\u0027t have bought it at that price if \nyou had known about the\ndefect.\n\n\nThe third case which is much rarer , is \nif you are able to show that the vendor had\nknowledge of the defect (hidden), but didn\u0027t \ninform you. In this case, not only does he \nhave to reimburse the product, but all \nexpenses incurred by the sale (metro \ntickets to go to the shop, the fuse \nwhich blew when you plugged it in \u0026c.)\n\n\nThis idea of \"hidden defect\" applies to\n all products, including programmes. This \nwas made abundantly clear by the \nauthorities (and the courts) surrounding \nY2K. \n\nThis is particularly inconvenient for \nfree programmes, since a site which \noffers a Linux distro for download is \nsupposed to provide a guarantee against \nhidden flaws.\n\n\nLinuxFrench asked Cyril ROJINSKY if \nin the case of a free programme, \none could speak about a \"hidden\" defect \nsince the source code was available, \nhe replied \"Actually, concerning the \nguarantee, the question of obvious \ndefect will arise. This analyis will \nbe different depending on whether the \nuser who downloads the distribution\nis an IT professional or not\". \n\nOpenSource has this advantage over \nthe proprietary programme: it protects \nthe distributor against a guarantee of\nhidden defect insofar as the buy is an \nIT user. But, for distribution to the\npublic at large, the problem remains \nthe same.\n\n\n\nRoughly Speaking.\n\n\nLawyer Cyril ROJINSKY said it himself, \nthis study is far from being exhaustive \nand many other areas could be explored. \n\nDuring this interview, we asked ourselves, \nfor example, about the fragility of the \nGPL clause which forbids linking source \ncode under the GPL with proprietary code. \n\nIn effect, the laws of intellectual \nproperty give the right to the user \nto modify a programme with the\nintention of permitting interoperability \nwith another programme. If for that,\nI need to link with a proprietary library \n(communication protocol, device driver)\nI may consider as \"null and void\" this \nclause of the GPL.\n\n\nThe conclusion of this study is a wake \nup call for the community. \"Freedom\" \nmerits more than these shoddy licences, \nwhich should be modified before court \ncases over them proliferate and put at \nrisk the undeniable originality of \nthis effort.\n\n\n---------------------------\n\n\n[1] Une publication de l\u0027Institut \nde recherche en propri�t� \nintellectuelle, No4 Juillet 2002\n\n[2] Une telle clause de contrat \nqui est oppos�e � ce que dit la Loi \nfran�aise est qualifi�e en terme \njuridique de � clause r�put�e \nnon-�crite �, c\u0027est-�-dire \nqu\u0027on fait comme si cette clause \nn\u0027�tait pas �crite dans le contrat. \n\nC\u0027est pour cela par exemple que vous \npouvez signer un bail pour un \nappartement qui stipule que \nles enfants sont interdits dans \nl\u0027immeuble, et envisager sans \ninqui�tude d\u0027avoir quand m�me \nun enfant, en effet le code civil \nstipule que le devoir d\u0027un locataire \nd\u0027un appartement doit se comporter \nen � bon p�re de famille � \n\n[3] Article L131-3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n___________________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!? -- Une adresse @yahoo.fr gratuite et en fran�ais !\nYahoo!

Hettinga\nSunday, August 25, 2002\n\n(BOSTON) When you think about it one way, the FBI/Winter Hill vs.\nPatriarcha/Angiulo Cosa Nostra fight was just another race war\nbetween thugs.\n\nPut crudely, and at its most racist, the FBI and the Winter Hill Gang\nwere the (mostly) Irish thugs, and Patriarcha\u0027s \"family\" were, of\ncourse, the (mostly) Italian thugs.\n\n\nThink Scorsese\u0027s upcoming \"Gangs of New York\", only with\ncounter-reformatory overtones. Hoover\u0027s South Boston \"social-club\"\nputsch, starting in the mid 1960\u0027s, was particularly audacious in\nhindsight. The U.S. Federal Government actually decided to underwrite\na reversal of the prohibition-era capture of the nation\u0027s rackets by\nthe Italians from the Irish. The fact that the plot was hatched not\nfor New York, but for South Boston, the most Irish place in the US,\nonly makes even more gigantic the Big Lie that was told by the FBI to\nits ostensible political masters about bringing down organized crime\nthere once and for all.\n\nThe result, as we all found out, wasn\u0027t swapping the heroin of\nItalian Boston mob violence for Irish methadone. Hoover was,\nposthumously, swapping it for Oxycontin, or crystal methamphetamine\n- -- or, more properly, PCP. The absolute psychopathology of violence\nin Whitey Bulger\u0027s crack-cocaine-era reign of Boston\u0027s drug markets,\nlike the identical FBI-sponsored reigns or violent horror by other\nalso-rans in cities across the US as a whole, went up whole orders of\nmagnitude, not mere percentage points.\n\nAs Stalin said once, quantity has a quality all it\u0027s own. And, make\nno mistake, J. Edgar Hoover was directly responsible that \"quality\"\nof carnage, nation-wide.\n\n\nSo, yes, on paper at least, it really *was* just the swapping of one\ngang of racist thugs for another, and the result was, on paper, at\nleast, business as usual. Same stuff, different century, with\napparently decent people like Mr. Salvati et.al accidently ground on\nthe gears of \"justice\" like so much hamburger.\n\nHowever, to be much more macabre about it, that hamburger was\n\"greasing\", if you will, an auto de fe only a homicidal lunatic could\nlove: a perfectly functioning market, legislated out of existence --\non paper, if nowhere else -- by government fiat and the, back-door,\nbut still elitist, will to power of H.L. Mencken\u0027s famous \"bluenoses\nand busybodies\".\n\n\nIt all starts, like all true evil does, from the most innocent of\nbeginnings. What she couldn\u0027t do to alcohol, teatotaling Mrs. Grundy\nthen tried to do to anything else she could think of that had a\nsmaller, \"manageable\" demand. The bloody result was, like nine more\nheads of the hydra, an increasingly ubiquitous universal prohibition,\nin more markets, and for more things, as the 20th century wore on.\n\nEvery time some recreational drug was found to be addictive, or\nharmful, or physically distasteful, or carcinogenic -- or, now,\napparently, fattening -- and then prohibited, exactly the same thing\nhappened to its markets that happened to alcohol during the Volstead\nyears. A *larger* market than before the prohibition. Hugely\nlucrative profits for anyone with the moral stomach to violently\nscale newly-legislated \"barriers to competition\" imposed on them by\nthe state. Increasingly violent attacks by the government on users of\nthose substances. And, finally, the ultimate in evil -- the kind of\nevil this country actually fought wars to end -- increasingly\ncoercive axe-handle beatings, by our own government, of the sacred\nliberty of the average, but now unavoidably-law-breaking, citizenry.\n\nAs Ayn Rand cynically observed a long time ago, you don\u0027t need\ngovernment if nobody\u0027s breaking the law. In some twisted corollary to\nParkinson\u0027s Law, governments, to survive, *need* more people,\nbreaking more laws, or they can never justify the money they\nconfiscate at tax time.\n\nAnd, to bring us back to the point, David Friedman would probably\necho here his father Milton\u0027s famous observation that government\nregulations only benefit the regulated sellers in a given market, and\nnever the consumer, much less the economy as a whole. Even,\n*especially*, if those sellers are *breaking* the law, as they are in\nthe increasingly ubiquitous prohibition of risky behavior that our\ngovernment now imposes on us.\n\n\nAnd there, absent the apparent grace of Mr. Hoover, went Mr. Salvati.\n\nIn fact, Hayek himself, in \"The Road to Serfdom\", couldn\u0027t have\npredicted any better the gory consequences of Hoover\u0027s blatant\nimposition, \"for our own good\", of Vietnam-era statist power at the\nneighborhood level. And, furthermore, *Stalin* couldn\u0027t have had\nbetter \"useful idiots\" than Hoover did -- and neither, by an\nabsolutely literal extension, did Whitey Bulger after Hoover.\n\nUseful idiots on both sides of the congressional aisle. Idiots who\nwere eating out of Hoover\u0027s power-craven hand for the entire middle\nof the 20th century -- and Whitey Bulger\u0027s hand, whether they knew it\nor not, until the end of the millennium. A time, you\u0027ll notice, which\nsaw the increasingly steady imposition of \"mob\" violence, and market\ncontrol, from both state and illegal interests, way beyond the\nimaginings of even the most power-mad, rum-running, stock-kiting,\nmovie-flopping, bureau-pumping, Nazi-appeasing Irish-Bostonian Little\nCaesar. Or, as for that matter, his safely trust-funded, and now\nstrictly political, descendents.\n\nIn terms of actual financial economics, think of what happened to Mr.\nSalvati and the others, dead or alive, as a \"transfer-price\", in\nhuman lives, of the inevitable consequence of MacNamara-style\nVietnam-era Keynesian \"social-cost\" input-output accounting at its\nmost despicable, and you can almost begin to fathom the atrocity that\nwas committed by Hoover, and his co-religionists in state economic\ncontrol, in the name of what really was, as you\u0027ll now agree, just a\nrace war between thugs up in Boston.\n\n\nThis shouldn\u0027t be a surprise, really. All race wars are at least\nfought by thugs, though they\u0027re usually conceived elsewhere, and\nendorsed, at the time, by all the \"right\" people, for all the \"right\"\nreasons.\n\nAs far as the FBI itself goes, remember Mancur Olson\u0027s observation\nthat a \"prince\" is just a stationary bandit.\n\nThough, given his penchant for women\u0027s clothing, for other men, and,\nwhat\u0027s actually obscene, for violently hypocritical treatment of\npeople of his own affectional preference, I suppose we can call J.\nEdgar Hoover a bandit \"princess\", instead.\n\n\"Bandit Queen\", of course, would be a grievous insult to queens --\nand real bandits -- everywhere.\n\nCheers,\nRAH\n- ---------\n\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/25/national/25FBI.html?todaysheadlines\u003d\n\u0026pagewanted\u003dprint\u0026position\u003dtop\n\n\nThe New York Times\nAugust 25, 2002\nHoover\u0027s F.B.I. and the Mafia: Case of Bad Bedfellows Grows By FOX\nBUTTERFIELD\n\nBOSTON, Aug. 24 - It was March 1965, in the early days of J. Edgar\nHoover\u0027s war against the Mafia. F.B.I. agents, say Congressional\ninvestigators, eavesdropped on a conversation in the headquarters of\nNew England\u0027s organized-crime boss, Raymond Patriarca.\n\nTwo gangsters, Joseph Barboza and Vincent Flemmi, wanted Mr.\nPatriarca\u0027s permission to kill a small-time hoodlum, Edward Deegan,\n\"as they were having a problem with him,\" according to an F.B.I. log\nof the conversation. \"Patriarca ultimately furnished this O.K.,\" the\nF.B.I. reported, and three days later Mr. Deegan turned up dead in an\nalley, shot six times.\n\nIt was an extraordinary situation: The Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation had evidence ahead of time that two well-known\ngangsters were planning a murder and that the head of the New England\nMafia was involved.\n\nBut when indictments in the case were handed down in 1967, the real\nkillers - who also happened to be informers for the F.B.I. - were\nleft alone. Four other men were tried, convicted and sentenced to\ndeath or life in prison for the murder, though they had had nothing\nto do with it.\n\nOne, Joseph Salvati, who spent 30 years in prison, filed notice with\nthe Justice Department last week that he planned to sue the F.B.I.\nfor $300 million for false imprisonment.\n\nHis is the latest in a series of lawsuits against the F.B.I., the\nJustice Department and some F.B.I. agents growing out of the tangled,\ncorrupt collaboration between gangsters and the F.B.I.\u0027s Boston\noffice in its effort to bring down the mob.\n\nThe lawsuits are based on evidence uncovered in the last five years\nin a judicial hearing and a Justice Department inquiry. But some of\nthe most explosive evidence has only recently come to light,\nincluding documents detailing conversation in which Mr. Patriarca\napproved the murder. They were released as part of an investigation\nby the House Committee on Government Reform, which has pressured the\ndepartment into turning over records about the F.B.I in Boston.\n\nThe documents show that officials at F.B.I. headquarters, apparently\nincluding Mr. Hoover, knew as long ago as 1965 that Boston agents\nwere employing killers and gang leaders as informers and were\nprotecting them from prosecution.\n\n\"J. Edgar Hoover crossed over the line and became a criminal\nhimself,\" said Vincent Garo, Mr. Salvati\u0027s lawyer. \"He allowed a\nwitness to lie to put an innocent man in prison so he could protect\none of his informants.\"\n\nMr. Barboza was a crucial witness at trial against Mr. Salvati and\nmay have implicated him because Mr. Salvati owed $400 to a loan shark\nwho worked for Mr. Barboza.\n\nAsked about the documents showing that Mr. Hoover knew of Mr.\nSalvati\u0027s innocence when he was put on trial, Gail Marcinkiewicz, a\nspokeswoman for the F.B.I. in Boston, declined to comment, citing the\npending litigation.\n\nA Justice Department task force is continuing to investigate\nmisconduct in the Boston office. In one of the first results of the\ninvestigation, one retired agent, John J. Connolly, is awaiting\nsentencing next month after being convicted of racketeering and\nobstruction of justice for helping two other mob leaders who were\nF.B.I. informers, James Bulger and Stephen Flemmi. Vincent and\nStephen Flemmi are brothers.\n\nThe Government Reform Committee, led by Representative Dan Burton,\nRepublican of Indiana, has uncovered memorandums from the Boston\noffice to headquarters in Washington revealing the bureau\u0027s knowledge\nthat Vincent Flemmi and Mr. Barboza were involved in killing Mr.\nDeegan. A memorandum a week after the killing described the crime,\nincluding who fired the first shot.\n\nThen, on June 4, 1965, Mr. Hoover\u0027s office demanded to know what\nprogress was being made in developing Vincent Flemmi as an informer.\n\nIn a reply five days later, the special agent in charge of the Boston\noffice said that Mr. Flemmi was in a hospital recovering from gunshot\nwounds but because of his connections to Mr. Patriarca \"potentially\ncould be an excellent informant.\"\n\nThe agent also informed Mr. Hoover that Mr. Flemmi was known to have\nkilled seven men, \"and, from all indications, he is going to continue\nto commit murder.\" Nevertheless, the agent said, \"the informant\u0027s\npotential outweighs the risk involved.\"\n\nA Congressional investigator called the exchange chilling. \"The most\nfrightening part is that after being warned about Flemmi\u0027s murders,\nthe director does not even respond,\" the investigator said. \"There is\nno message not to use a murderer as a government informant.\"\n\nThe origin of the corruption scandal was public and political\npressure on Mr. Hoover to move more forcefully against the growing\npower of the Mafia, which he had largely ignored. In Boston, F.B.I.\nagents recruited Mr. Barboza and Mr. Flemmi and developed close ties\nto a rival criminal organization, the Winter Hill Gang, led by Mr.\nBulger.\n\nBoth sides got what they wanted, according to the investigations and\nthe trial of Mr. Connolly. The F.B.I. got information that eventually\nhelped destroy the Patriarca and Angiulo families, which controlled\norganized crime in New England. Mr. Bulger\u0027s gang was able to take\nover the rackets in Boston, sell drugs and even commit murder while\nthe F.B.I. looked the other way.\n\nOne reason the F.B.I. may not have used its information about Mr.\nPatriarca\u0027s involvement in the Deegan murder, Congressional\ninvestigators say, is that it came from an illegal listening device\nin his Providence, R.I., headquarters. The F.B.I. agent who\ntranscribed the conversation made it appear that the information was\ncoming from unnamed informants, to disguise the use of the device,\nthe investigators say.\n\nMr. Salvati, a former truck driver, now 69, had his sentence commuted\nin 1997 by Gov. William F. Weld. Last year, while he was still on\nparole, his murder conviction was dismissed by a Massachusetts state\njudge after the Justice Department task force made public documents\nsuggesting his innocence.\n\nTwo of the other wrongly convicted men died in prison. Their\nsurvivors have joined the fourth man, Peter Limone, in a $375 million\nlawsuit against the Justice Department. Mr. Limone was sentenced to\ndie in the electric chair. His life was spared only when\nMassachusetts outlawed the death penalty in 1974.\n\nMr. Salvati lives in a modest apartment in Boston\u0027s North End with\nhis wife, Marie, who visited him in prison every week during those 30\nyears. Each week Mr. Salvati sent her a romantic card, which she put\non the television set. It was, Mr. Garo said, all they had of each\nother.\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: PGP 7.5\n\niQA/AwUBPWmB2sPxH8jf3ohaEQL9qgCgxHq0ee06UEsNv8u8wgvmjf9K7S4An3Rb\n3srsGomWjNDwIaKoEHOfNHpI\n\u003dOELD\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n-- \n-----------------\nR.

The water is coming from the bathroom, the\ntoilet specifically. Turns out the water cistern on the top of the toilet\nhad cracked down the side, and was spilling out all the water.\n\nSo, after shutting off the water and mopping up, I was left to ponder what\nare the odds of having mechanical failure of a large rectangular porcelain\nbowl, in the absence of any visible stressors (like someone striking it with\na sledgehammer)? We hadn\u0027t done anything unusual to the toilet in the recent\npast -- just normal use. I\u0027ve *never* heard of this happening to anyone I\nknow. The guts, yeah, they fail all the time. But the storage bowl -- never.\n\nGeesh.\n\n- Jim\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n",

I *do* care about content.  Hell,\nif I could be convinced that people would send stupid pics back and forth\nall day, I\u0027d have a different opinion of this.  I just am not convinced\nthat they will (stupid or not).\n\nWhile a picture may be worth a thousand words (and this is the same\nargument the guy who works for me made), how many people do you know who\ncommunicate by pictures?  Sure, it sounds nice to say that a picture is\nsuch an efficient messaging mechanism, but how often do you actually find\nyourself drawing someone a picture to explain something?\n\nI don\u0027t buy it.\n\nFor most messages, text works fine and is the most efficient\nmechanism.  For some messages, pictures do the job, but I would say not\nnearly as often as words.  Why do you think Pictionary and Charades and\nsuch are games?  Because images are usually not the most efficient way to\nget a message across.\n\n\u003emisc ramblings: i suppose you skeptical forkers would have said the same\n\u003ething about \u00271 hour photo\u0027 processing.  trivial, who needs it, i get better\n\u003eresultion elswhere.  and yet, it had great decentralizing impact - the\nplant\n\u003ehad to be downsized and pushed to the retail operation - the digital\ncamera,\n\u003eand finally the integrated digital camera phone brings this cycle of\n\u003edecentralization in photography to a logical conclusion (which will put the\n\u003ephoto giants to bed) and change the world in a meaningful way.  also, SMS\n\u003edidn\u0027t take off because its easy, it took off because it costs less.  its\n\u003egreatly ironic the carriers often trumpet the \u0027profitabilty\u0027 of their SMS\n\u003etraffic over others because of its ratio of cost to bandwidth.  in reality,\n\u003eSMS cannibilizes the voice rev\u0027s they bought their networks to handle.\n\nAgain, this is the same argument my colleague made (along with \"you just\ndon\u0027t understand kids today, and they\u0027ll run with this\").  I wasn\u0027t saying\nthat MMS wouldn\u0027t take off because it wasn\u0027t high quality or that it wasn\u0027t\neasy.  I was saying that I couldn\u0027t see why people would use it in a way\nthat \"changed the face of communications\".\n\nI\u0027m looking for the compelling reason (even if it\u0027s a stupid one) why\npeople would want to do this.  Sure, if they integrate cameras into the\nphone, and the quality improves (even only marginally) I can certainly see\npeople taking pictures with their cameras and occasionally sending them to\nother people.  But, mostly, I don\u0027t see what the benefit is to this over\nsending them to someone\u0027s email address, or putting together an online (or\noffline) photoalbum.\n\nI don\u0027t think 1 hour photos are trivial.  People want to see their own pics\nright away, and the quality is plenty good enough for snapshots.  That\u0027s\none of the main reasons why digital cameras are catching on.  The instant\nview part.  I\u0027m guessing your argument is that people not only want\n\"instant view\", but also \"instant show\".  Which is what this service\noffers.  I\u0027m not convinced that most people want \"instant show\".  I think\npeople like to package their pictures and show them.  That\u0027s why people put\ntogether fancy albums, and sit there and force you to go through them while\nthey explain every picture.  Sure, occasionally \"instant show\" is nice, but\nit\u0027s just \"nice\" on occasion.  I still can\u0027t see how it becomes a integral\nmessaging method.\n\nWhat\u0027s the specific benefit of taking a picture and immediately sending it\nfrom one phone to another?  There has to be *some* benefit, even if it\u0027s\nsilly if people are going to flock to it.\n\nI\u0027m searching... no one has given me a straight answer yet.\n\nThe *only* really intriguing idea I\u0027ve heard about things like MMS lately\nare Dan Gillmor\u0027s assertion that one day in the near future some news event\nwill happen, and a bunch of people will snap pictures with their mobile\nphones, from all different angles, and those photos tell the real story of\nwhat happened - before the press even gets there.\n\nWilling to be proven wrong,\nMike\n\nPS If the wireless carriers continue to price these services as stupidly as\nthey currently are, then MMS is *never* going to catch on.\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n",

    "message": "\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat is MIME?\n\nMIME stands for \"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions\".  It is the\nstandard for how to send multipart, multimedia, and binary data using the\nworld-wide Internet email system.  Typical uses of MIME include sending\nimages, audio, wordprocessing documents, programs, or even plain text\nfiles when it is important that the mail system does not modify any part\nof the file.  MIME also allows for labelling message parts so that a\nrecipient (or mail program) may determine what to do with them. \n\nHow can I read a MIME message?\n\nSince MIME is only a few years old, there are still some mailers in use\nwhich do not understand MIME messages.  However, there are a growing\nnumber of mail programs that have MIME support built-in.  (One popular\nMIME-capable mailer for Unix, VMS and PCs is Pine, developed at the\nUniversity of Washington and available via anonymous FTP from the host\nftp.cac.washington.edu in the file /pine/pine.tar.Z)\n\nIn addition, several proprietary email systems provide MIME translation\ncapability in their Internet gateway products.  However, even if you do\nnot have access to a MIME-capable mailer or suitable gateway, there is\nstill hope! \n\nThere are a number of stand-alone programs that can interpret a MIME\nmessage.  One of the more versatile is called \"munpack\".  It was developed\nat Carnegie Mellon University and is available via anonymous FTP from the\nhost ftp.andrew.cmu.edu in the directory pub/mpack/.  There are versions\navailable for Unix, PC, Mac and Amiga systems.  For compabibility with\nolder forms of transferring binary files, the munpack program can also\ndecode messages in split-uuencoded format. \n\nDoes MIME replace UUENCODE?\n\nYes.  UUENCODE has been used for some time for encoding binary files so\nthat they can be sent via Internet mail, but it has several technical\nlimitations and interoperability problems.  MIME uses a more robust\nencoding called \"Base64\" which has been carefully designed to survive the\nmessage transformations made by certain email gateways. \n\nHow can I learn more about MIME?\n\nThe MIME Internet standard is described in RFC-1521, available via\nanonymous FTP from many different Internet hosts, including: \n                                                       \n     o  US East Coast                            \n        Address:  ds.internic.net (198.49.45.10)        \n                                                        \n     o  US West Coast                            \n        Address:  ftp.isi.edu (128.9.0.32)      \n                                                        \n     o  Pacific Rim                              \n        Address:  munnari.oz.au (128.250.1.21)  \n                                                        \n     o  Europe                                   \n        Address:  nic.nordu.net (192.36.148.17) \n\nLook for the file /rfc/rfc1521.txt\n\nAnother source of information is the Internet news group \"comp.mail.mime\",\nwhich includes a periodic posting of a \"Frequently Asked Questions\" list.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n",

I think that there are a couple\nof nits I might pick (for example, I don\u0027t expect that the market will\nbe well developed with highest bidders for while), I think that the\nmost important issue, which is that end users won\u0027t be able to fix\ntheir systems, is almost passed over.  I know that you know this, and\nyou allude to it, but your essay is getting passed around, so you\nmight want to add to it bits about the sysadmin and others.\n\n   There\u0027s one other point which you don\u0027t make, which I think is very\nimportant, which is that research into defining and addressing classes\nof vulnerabilities can\u0027t happen without libraries of available\nvulnerability code.  I can think of three researchers into automated\nmethods for addressing vulnerabilities who griped, uninvited, about\nthe quality of the existing vulnerability sites.

Briefly, \"iDEFENSE\", which bills\n| itself as \"a global security intelligence company\", is offering cash\n| for information about security vulnerabilities in computer software\n| that are not publicly known, especially if you promise not to tell\n| anyone else.\n| \n| If this kind of secret traffic is allowed to continue, it will pose a\n| very serious threat to our computer communications infrastructure.\n| \n| At the moment, the dominant paradigm for computer security research\n| known as \"full disclosure\"; people who discover security\n| vulnerabilities in software tell the vendor about them, and a short\n| while later --- after the vendor has had a chance to fix the problem\n| --- they publish the information, including code to exploit the\n| vulnerability, if possible.  \n| \n| This method has proven far superior to the old paradigm established by\n| CERT in the late 1980s, which its proponents might call \"responsible\n| disclosure\" --- never release working exploit code, and never release\n| any information on the vulnerability before all vendors have released\n| a patch.  This procedure often left hundreds of thousands of computers\n| vulnerable to known bugs for months or years while the vendors worked\n| on features, and often, even after the patches were released, people\n| wouldn\u0027t apply them because they didn\u0027t know how serious the problem\n| was.\n| \n| The underground computer criminal community would often discover and\n| exploit these same holes for months or years while the \"responsible\n| disclosure\" process kept their victims, who had no connections in the\n| underground, vulnerable.\n| \n| The problem with this is that vulnerabilities that are widely known\n| are much less dangerous, because their victims can take steps to\n| reduce their potential impact --- including disabling software,\n| turning off vulnerable features, filtering traffic in transit, and\n| detecting and responding to intrusions.  They are therefore much less\n| useful to would-be intruders.  Also, software companies usually see\n| security vulnerabilities in their software as PR problems, and so\n| prefer to delay publication (and the expense of fixing the bugs) as\n| long as possible.\n| \n| iDEFENSE is offering a new alternative that appears far more dangerous\n| than either of the two previous paradigms.  They want to be a buyer in\n| a marketplace for secret software vulnerability information, rewarding\n| discoverers of vulnerabilities with cash.  \n| \n| Not long before, Snosoft, a group of security researchers evidently\n| including some criminal elements, apparently made an offer to sell the\n| secrecy of some software vulnerability information to the software\n| vendor; specifically, they apparently made a private offer to\n| Hewlett-Packard to keep a vulnerability in HP\u0027s Tru64 Unix secret if\n| HP retained Snosoft\u0027s \"consulting services\".  HP considered this\n| extortion and responded with legal threats, and Snosoft published the\n| information.\n| \n| If this is allowed to happen, it will cause two problems which,\n| together, add up to a catastrophe.\n| \n| First, secret software vulnerability information will be available to\n| the highest bidder, and to nobody else.  For reasons explained later,\n| I think the highest bidders will generally be organized crime\n| syndicates, although that will not be obvious to the sellers.\n| \n| Second, finding software vulnerabilities and keeping them secret will\n| become lucrative for many more talented people.  The result will be\n| --- just as in the \"responsible disclosure\" days --- that the good\n| guys will remain vulnerable for months and years, while the majority\n| of current vulnerabilities are kept secret.\n| \n| I\u0027ve heard it argued that the highest bidders will generally be the\n| vendors of the vulnerable software, but I don\u0027t think that\u0027s\n| plausible.  If someone can steal $20 000 because a software bug lets\n| them, the software vendor is never held liable; often, in fact, the\n| people who administer the software aren\u0027t liable, either --- when\n| credit card data are stolen from an e-commerce site, for example.\n| Knowing about a vulnerability before anyone else might save a web-site\n| administrator some time, and it might save the software vendor some\n| negative PR, but it can net the thief thousands of dollars.\n| \n| I think the highest bidders will be those for whom early vulnerability\n| information is most lucrative --- the thieves who can use it to\n| execute the largest heists without getting caught.  Inevitably, that\n| means organized crime syndicates, although the particular gangs who\n| are good at networked theft may not yet exist.\n| \n| There might be the occasional case where a market leader, such as\n| Microsoft, could make more money by giving their competitors bad PR\n| than a gang could make by theft.  Think of a remote-root hole in\n| Samba, for example.\n| \n| Right now, people who know how to find security exploits are either\n| motivated by personal interest in the subject, motivated by the public\n| interest, motivated by a desire for individual recognition, or\n| personally know criminals that benefit from their exploits.  Creating\n| a marketplace in secret vulnerability information would vastly\n| increase the availability of that information to the people who can\n| afford to pay the most for it: spies, terrorists, and organized crime.\n| \n| Let\u0027s not let that happen.\n| \n| \n| \n| \n| This is the original iDEFENSE announcement:\n| \n| From: Sunil James [mailto:SJames@iDefense.com]\n| Sent: Wednesday, August 07, 2002 12:32 PM\n| Subject: Introducing iDEFENSE\u0027s Vulnerability Contributor Program\n| \n| \n| Greetings,\n| \n| iDEFENSE is pleased to announce the official launch of its Vulnerability\n| Contributor Program (VCP). The VCP pays contributors for the advance\n| notification of vulnerabilities, exploit code and malicious code.\n| \n| iDEFENSE hopes you might consider contributing to the VCP. The following\n| provides answers to some basic questions about the program:\n| \n| Q. How will it work?\n| A. iDEFENSE understands the majority of security researchers do not publish\n| security research for compensation; rather, it could be for any of a number\n| of motivations, including the following:\n| \n|          * Pure love of security research\n|          * The desire to protect against harm to targeted networks\n|          * The desire to urge vendors to fix their products\n|          * The publicity that often accompanies disclosure\n| \n| The VCP is for those who want to have their research made public to the\n| Internet community, but who would also like to be paid for doing the\n| work.The compensation will depend, among other things, on the following\n| items:\n| \n|          * The kind of information being shared (i.e. vulnerability or exploit)\n|          * The amount of detail and analysis provided\n|          * The potential severity level for the information shared\n|          * The types of applications, operating systems, and other\n|            software and hardware potentially affected\n|          * Verification by iDEFENSE Labs\n|          * The level of exclusivity, if any, for data granted to iDEFENSE\n| \n| Q. Who should contribute to the VCP?\n| A. The VCP is open to any individual, security research group or other\n| entity.\n| \n| Q. Why are you launching this program?\n| A. Timeliness remains a key aspect in security intelligence. Contributions\n| to some lists take time before publication to the public at large. More\n| often, many of these services charge clients for access without paying the\n| original contributor. Under the iDEFENSE program, the contributor is\n| compensated, iDEFENSE Labs verifies the issue, and iDEFENSE clients and the\n| public at large are warned in a timely manner.\n| \n| Q. Who gets the credit?\n| A. The contributor is always credited for discovering the vulnerability or\n| exploit information.\n| \n| Q. When can I contribute?\n| The VCP is active. You are welcome to begin contributing today.\n| \n| To learn more, go to http://www.idefense.com/contributor.html. If you have\n| questions or would like to sign up as a contributor to the VCP, please\n| contact us at contributor@idefense.com.\n| \n| Regards,\n| \n| Sunil James\n| Technical Analyst\n| iDEFENSE\n| \n| \"iDEFENSE is a global security intelligence company that proactively\n| monitors sources throughout the world -- from technical vulnerabilities and\n| hacker profiling to the global spread of viruses and other malicious code.\n| The iALERT security intelligence service provides decision-makers, frontline\n| security professionals and network administrators with timely access to\n| actionable intelligence and decision support on cyber-related threats.\n| iDEFENSE Labs is the research wing that verifies vulnerabilities, examines\n| the behavior of exploits and other malicious code and discovers new\n| software/hardware weaknesses in a controlled lab environment.\"\n| \n| http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n| \n\n-- \n\"It is seldom that liberty of any kind is lost all at once.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t               -Hume\n\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n",

He might have dreamed of becoming an\nace code-cracker for the CIA or the National Security Agency, or imagined\ntoppling an empire with revolutionary software. Maybe he would have tried to\nuse the Internet to end world hunger.\n\nBut as Yandziak attends his first college classes this week, he\u0027s harboring\ndifferent academic ambitions. The Ashburn native says he wants to do\nsomething more social and more interesting than working with computers.\n\nBesides, he said while packing for a Charlottesville dormitory room, \"you\ncan\u0027t get the chicks with that anymore.\"\n\nThe tech industry\u0027s financial problems are enough to bankrupt the dreams of\nsome fair-weather students. But now there\u0027s another consequence of the tech\nbust: Enrollment growth in undergraduate computer science departments has\ncome to a halt.\n\nThe number of undergraduates majoring in computer science fell 1 percent in\n2001, according to a report by the Computing Research Association. And\neducators in the field say the trend seems to be accelerating, with some\ncolleges seeing much greater drops as the new academic year begins.\n\nThe word is out among department deans that the bust\u0027s fallout has trickled\ninto the classroom, said Maria Clavez, president of the Association of\nComputing Machinery.\n\n\"I\u0027ve heard everything from no change to modest decline to more dramatic\ndeclines,\" said Clavez, who will become the dean of science and engineering\nat Princeton University in January. \"It can be hard to see this, because at\nsome colleges the number of people who want to study computer science so far\nexceeds the available space. [But] it is going to have an effect.\"\n\nAt Virginia Tech, enrollment of undergraduates in the computer science\ndepartment will drop 25 percent this year, to 300. At George Washington\nUniversity, the number of incoming freshmen who plan to study computer\nscience fell by more than half this year.\n\nInterest in undergraduate computer science programs had grown rapidly in the\npast decade. In 1997, schools with PhD programs in computer science and\ncomputer engineering granted 8,063 degrees, according to the Computing\nResearch Association. The numbers rose through 2001, when 17,048 degrees\nwere awarded.\n\nThe Labor Department projects that software engineering will be the\nfastest-growing occupation between 2000 and 2010, with other\ncomputer-related industries trailing close behind.\n\nBut in the short term that growth may slow, based on the changes among\ncollege students. For example, 900 of the 2,000-plus undergraduates studying\ninformation technology and engineering at George Mason University were\ncomputer science majors last year. This year the enrollment in that major is\ndown to 800, although a newly created and more general information\ntechnology major has attracted 200 students.\n\n\"Having it ease off for a while is a bit of a relief,\" said Lloyd Griffith,\ndean of George Mason\u0027s information technology and engineering school.\n\"Particularly with the field as it has been, they don\u0027t want to spend four\nyears on something and then not get a job.\"\n\nFreshman enrollment for the University of Maryland\u0027s computer science major\nis expected to be about 167 this fall, down from 329 last year. Maryland\ndecreased its total freshman enrollment by 11 percent, but that alone does\nnot account for the drop, said Steve Halperin, dean of Maryland\u0027s College of\nComputer, Mathematical and Physical Sciences.\n\n\"We are seeing a decrease in the number of freshmen who are declaring their\ninterest in pursuing computer science as a major,\" Halperin said. \"That\u0027s a\nfactual statement. But I would say that at this point . . . we don\u0027t expect\nto see a decrease in the number of graduates. Many of the kids who are no\nlonger expressing an interest in majoring in CS would have fallen off.\"\n\nYandziak, who began at the University of Virginia on Saturday, is not\nconvinced that\u0027s the case. He graduated in the top 5 percent of his class,\nwith a 3.9 grade-point average, and nailed the highest possible score on his\nadvanced-placement exam in computer science.\n\n\"All of my classes have been easy for me. Math and sciences were always fun,\nso I looked for professions in which I could use those things,\" Yandziak\nsaid. \"I\u0027m just not sure I want my life to be immersed in [technology]. I\nwant to do something that will contribute to the practical world.\"\n\nHarris N. Miller, president of the Information Technology Association of\nAmerica, said the last time there was a dearth of computing professionals,\nsalaries skyrocketed and workers benefited from the labor shortage.\n\n\"There was a tremendous imbalance in the late \u002790s; potentially you have the\nsame sort of thing going on right now. People are saying, \u0027I don\u0027t need this\nkind of IT training right now,\u0027 \" Miller said. \"Our concern as an industry\nis that if they begin to again see major declines in enrollment, down the\nroad four years, as the economy picks up, once again companies are going to\nfind themselves in a shortage situation.\"\n\nEconomic potential weighs heavily in many student career choices, but other\nfactors, including program difficulty, personal interests and social\ninfluences, also come into play, said Judy Hingle, director of professional\ndevelopment at the American College Counseling Association. The perception\nof computer science as an isolating, \"nerdy\" profession is one that many in\nthe industry have tried to squelch. That stereotype went underground during\nthe tech bubble but reemerged during the bust.\n\n\"All the hipness is gone,\" Yandziak said. \"Once we thought of the Internet\nas this thing with infinite capabilities. It was basically just a fad that\ncame along.\"\n\nLamont Thompson, a recent graduate of Calvin Coolidge Senior High School in\nthe District, is headed to Morehouse College in Atlanta to study business\nmarketing, with the intention of going into real estate development.\n\n\"Technology comes natural to people my age; it\u0027s not fascinating anymore,\"\nThompson said. \"To be honest with you, when I think computer science, I\nthink of some guy sitting behind a computer all day in a dark room. It\u0027s a\nnecessity, but I wouldn\u0027t take it any further.\"\n\n",

Things have got much better... You\u0027re right in that the JDK used to\nsuck on Linux... But then, IMHO, Linux is still maturing.... or at least\ndevelopment tools for Linux are maturing... I\u0027ve been developing a few\nserver side apps that run on Linux recently with JDK 1.3.x and they\u0027ve had\nno problems with great performance.\n\nRobert Harley worte:\n\u003eMicrosoft has announced that they plan to remove Java from Windows.\n\u003eThey took it out of XP already and it has to be installed with a\n\u003eservice pack.

Or that MS has\nbasically copied Java (with some additional features) and called it C#?\nIsn\u0027t that alone an indication that they actually DO think that a VM is the\nright way to go for most high level applications?\n\nReza B\u0027Far wrote:\n\u003e2.

Depends\n\u003eentirely on the programmer, not the language.\n\nI can see how you could infer this. However, what I believe to really be the\ncase is that Java is one of the best languages for writing large\napplications with many components that involves the collaboration of more\nthan three programmers.  In those cases, it\u0027s always very hard to get the\nprogrammers to agree on API\u0027s, memory management techniques, etc.  With\nJava, the JCP takes care of the discussions so that you don\u0027t sit around in\na long meeting trying to decide what API to use to hook up to a database\n(JDBC) or a messaging bus (JMS).\n\n\n\u003e3.

(aside to the minimal ANSI stuff).  Is there a standard way of\ndealing with C/C++ applications for various domain problems (messaging,\ndatabase persistence, etc.) that rivals Java?  I\u0027d like to know if there is\none accepted by everyone who writes C/C++... In that case, I claim\nignorance...\n\nNot suggesting that Java is the golden hammer.... Just that C/C++ is\noverkill for most things... I even coded in VB... But VB is a true disgrace\nto programming... It\u0027s just lame... Java is Object Oriented... (no\nflame-mail from the anti-OO people please... that is a religious\ndiscussion...) and relatively clean... And I don\u0027t think that every \"Kid\"\ncan write a well designed Java program.  Kids typically don\u0027t understand\nvarious design patterns and principles... To my experience, they actually\ntend to think more of the low level problems, wanting to rewrite and\nreinvent the world... a tendency that is much more possible, IMHO, in C/C++\nthan in Java due to existence of standard API\u0027s.\n\n",

If that electrical energy could all be converted to kinetic\nenergy, there\u0027s enough to get the capacitor module up to about 200 mph -- in\na vacuum.\n\nSuppose you take the entire power density of the capacitor module -- 2.8\nkw/kg (~4 hp/kg!) --  and punch it through an electric motor.  How much does\nthe 64 hp electric motor weigh?  If it were as little as 50 kg -- and I bet\nit isn\u0027t -- that capacitor and motor would have a top speed of 100 mph --\nthe speed at which their energy is the 128 kJ that was initially stored\nelectrically in the capacitor.  And it\u0027s not at all obvious that the torque\nvs. speed characteristic of 42 V DC motors will support this, or how they do\nit without wheels, drive train, etc.\n\nBut if they can, they can only do it in a vacuum where there is no drag!\n\nOn to the Lunarnationals?

    "message": "\nGlad they finally figured this one out... Note the very careful wording, so\nexhaust may be beneficial to ones health as long as you have a glass a day\nwith some cheese.\n\nInteresting timing, since 16,000 truckers just lost their jobs and dont have\nto worry about death from this anymore.\n\n- Adam L. \"Duncan\" Beberg\n  http://www.mithral.com/~beberg/\n  beberg@mithral.com\n\n--------\n\nEPA: Diesel Exhaust Can Cause Cancer\nWed Sep 4, 3:29 AM ET\nBy H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Inhaling diesel exhausts from large trucks and other\nsources over time can cause cancer in humans, an Environmental Protection\nAgency ( news - web sites) report concludes after a decade of study.\n\nThe EPA finding, released Tuesday, is expected to buttress the government\u0027s\npush to reduce truck tailpipe emissions by requiring cleaner-burning engines\nand diesel fuel with ultra-low sulfur content.\n\nWhile acknowledging uncertainties about the long-term health effects of\nexposure to diesel exhausts, the EPA report said studies involving both\nanimal tests and occupational exposure suggest strong evidence of a cancer\nrisk to humans.\n\n\"It is reasonable to presume that the hazard extends to environmental\nexposure levels\" as well, the report said. \"The potential human health\neffects of diesel exhausts is persuasive, even though assumptions and\nuncertainties are involved.\"\n\nThe report mirrors conclusions made previously in documents from various\nworld health agencies and studies in California and is particularly\nsignificant because the EPA is the federal agency that regulates diesel\nemissions under the Clean Air Act.\n\nSome environmentalists have raised concerns recently that the Bush\nadministration might try to back away from a Clinton-era regulation that\nwould establish tougher requirements on emissions from large trucks and a\nseparate rule that virtually would eliminate sulfur from diesel fuel.\n\nEPA Administrator Christie Whitman repeatedly has promised to go ahead with\nthe tougher truck and diesel rules. Last month, with White House approval,\nthe EPA rebuffed attempts by some diesel engine manufacturers to postpone\nthe requirements, approving new penalties against manufacturers who fail to\nmeet an October deadline for making cleaner-burning truck engines.\n\nThe engine rule does not affect emissions from trucks already on the road,\nalthough the separate regulation cutting the amount of sulfur in diesel fuel\nis expected to produce pollution reductions.\n\nThe EPA\u0027s 651-page diesel health assessment did not attempt to estimate the\nprobability of an individual getting cancer, given certain exposure to\ndiesel exhaust. Such a risk assessment is commonly made by the EPA when\ngauging pollution health concerns.\n\nBut in this case, the report said, \"the exposure-response data are\nconsidered too uncertain\" to produce a confident quantitative estimate of\ncancer risk to an individual.\n\nNevertheless, said the report, the \"totality of evidence from human, animal\nand other supporting studies\" suggests that diesel exhaust \"is likely to be\ncarcinogenic to humans by inhalation, and that this hazard applies to\nenvironmental exposure.\"\n\nThe report reiterated that environmental exposure to diesel exhausts poses\nshort-term health problems and in the long term has been shown to be a\n\"chronic respiratory hazard to humans\" contributing to increased asthma and\nother respiratory problems. In some urban areas diesel exhausts account for\nas much as a quarter of the airborne microscopic soot, the report said.\n\nEnvironmentalists welcomed the study as clear evidence that pollution needs\nto be curtailed not only from large trucks but also from off-road\ndiesel-powered vehicles. EPA spokeswoman Steffanie Bell said the agency\nexpects to publish a rule early next year dealing with those diesel exhaust\nsources, which include farm tractors and construction equipment.\n\nEmily Figdor of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a private\nenvironmental organization, said: \"To reduce the public\u0027s exposure to\nharmful diesel emissions, the Bush administration should ... fully implement\nclean air standards for diesel trucks and buses and should pass equivalent\nstandards for diesel construction and farm equipment.\"\n\nAllen Schaeffer, executive director of the industry group Diesel Technology\nForum, said the EPA\u0027s report \"focused on the past,\" whereas \"the future is\nclean diesel. Diesel trucks and buses built today are more than eight times\ncleaner than just a dozen years ago.\"\n\nThe report acknowledged that its findings were based on emissions levels in\nthe mid-1990s, but said the results continued to be valid because the slow\nturnover of truck engines has kept many of these vehicles on the road.\n\n\n",

    "subject": "CD player UI for toddlers",
    "message": "\nSo, like many young children, my daughter Tatum (age 21 months) *really*\nlikes music. She also likes to have control over her environment, and this\nmeans she wants to be the one putting CDs into the CD player, and getting\nthe music playing.\n\nBy watching Tatum, I\u0027ve discovered that you can learn a lot about UI design\nfrom watching 21-month-olds use technology. There is definitely a market\nniche for a toddler-friendly CD/MP3 player.\n\nThe CD player we have combines play and pause in a single button, but\ndoesn\u0027t provide *instantaneous* feedback that the button was pushed, instead\nrequiring you to wait until the music starts, 5-10 seconds. This is a UI\ndisaster. Since Tatum doesn\u0027t get feedback right away, she presses the\nbutton again, thereby pausing the CD before it even plays. She\u0027ll only ever\nget music if she presses the button an odd number of times. This happens a\nsurprising amount of the time, since she eventually hits the button again\nwhen the music doesn\u0027t play.\n\nFor toddlers, pressing play must cause the music to start immediately,\nwithin half a second, for the toddler to get the causality and not press the\nbutton multiple times. As well, pressing the button multiple times shouldn\u0027t\nchange the semantics, like an elevator button. No matter how many times you\npress, the elevator still comes to that floor. The play button needs to be\nthe same.\n\nThe back-hinged door mechanism feeding the CD into the player is also a UI\ndisaster for Tatum. Since the door hinges on the back, Tatum has to angle\nCDs to put them in, and take them out. Putting CDs in isn\u0027t much of a\nproblem, but taking them out is. Since Tatum grabs CDs by the back edge,\nthat edge comes out first, hitting the lid. Tatum eventually forces and\nwiggles the CD out, a process that\u0027s hard on the CD and the player (but\nwhich hasn\u0027t yet resulted in the CD player being broken). Surprisingly, it\nhasn\u0027t been a problem getting the CD hole onto the spindle -- Tatum seems to\nunderstand this concept, and the CD load area geometry naturally guides the\nCD.\n\nTatum\u0027s CD player also plays tapes and has FM radio. For a toddler, this is\na mistake. Tatum doesn\u0027t understand the need to flick a switch to put the\nplayer into a specific mode. She understands putting a CD in, and pressing\nthe play button. She sometimes understands the buttons for advancing a song,\nbut uses them erratically. As well, the radio feature has both FM mono and\nFM stero, a distinction totally lost on Tatum. Tatum only understands the\nbinary distinction of music/no music.\n\nWhat would the ideal toddler CD player be like? It would immediately start\nplaying a CD after it was loaded. As soon as the CD load door was closed, it\nwould give some audible feedback. It would have a single large play button.\nThe other typical CD controls would be larger than normal, but at least half\nthe size of the play button, and located far away from the play button, so\nthere is no chance of them getting accidentally pressed on the way to play.\nThe play button would be a bright color that is different from the color of\nthe player, and different from the color of the other CD control keys. The\ndevice would only play CDs, no other functions. The CD load area would flip\nopen at least 80 degrees. It should be small, approachable for a toddler. It\nshould be possible to repeatedly drop the player from a height of 1-2\u0027\nwithout affecting the player.\n\n- Jim\n\n\n\n",

So I\u0027m not sure\n\u003e what you mean.\n\u003e \n\u003e I\u0027m not trying to fight a language war, but I\u0027m puzzled by the depth\n\u003e of your anti-Java hatred.\n\u003e \n\u003e  \u003e I know lots of high school\n\u003e  \u003e kiddies with plenty of Java tho, not having to teach people about\n\u003e  \u003e pointers or optimization or anything shaves years off the \n\u003e coder boot\n\u003e  \u003e time. I\u0027ll send them your way when they graduate.\n\u003e \n\u003e Pointers. So a language has to have pointers to be real? And \n\u003e references\n\u003e don\u0027t count, I gather. What\u0027s so great about pointers? Why do you\n\u003e miss them? If your doing embedded stuff, fine, yes, you need the\n\u003e performance and control over memory that C provides. Probably.\n\u003e But if your implementing tier N-1 of a tier N system, and pounding\n\u003e against a database, then Java is OFTEN a very reasonable choice.\n\u003e Especially if you want that system to run without leaking memory.\n\u003e \n\u003e Optimization. Who says you can\u0027t optimize Java? I can and have,\n\u003e and there are good tools that allow you to do it (I use OptimizeIt).\n\u003e But usually I find myself optimizing (reducing) database accesses\n\u003e instead. I sped one part of the system up by a factor of ten by\n\u003e grouping more operations into fewer transactions.\n\u003e \n\u003e But this is beside the point. If you have decent C++ experience, and\n\u003e have poked around in Java, you should be able to convince most\n\u003e employers that you can be trusted writing Java. That\u0027s what I did --\n\u003e I mean, I joined Kana from Microsoft, and I didn\u0027t exactly write\n\u003e a lot of Java code at Microsoft.\n\u003e \n\u003e  \u003e I\u0027m not displeased you\u0027re trying to help, just frustrated that\n\u003e  \u003e employers can demand such rediculous combinations of skills with\n\u003e  \u003e insane years of experience.\n\u003e \n\u003e I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever interviewed at a place where I actually\n\u003e met all the prerequisites. Do you just give up when you don\u0027t?\n\u003e \n\u003e  \u003e Interview tommorow with Kodak, doing I have no idea what as the\n\u003e  \u003e recruiter isnt even sure, but cross your fingers it wont require 10\n\u003e  \u003e years of Java and 5 years of Windows/IA-64\u0027s device driver \n\u003e experience\n\u003e  \u003e (both common requirements).\n\u003e \n\u003e I wish you best of luck, and I apologies for being a bitch.\n\u003e But God DAMN, you piss me off sometimes.

As you\nshould know, but evidently don\u0027t, poll() isn\u0027t even \"a bit better\" ---\nin fact, it\u0027s about an order of magnitude worse --- for dense file\ndescriptor sets, which is the normal case.  (Except on operating\nsystems where select() isn\u0027t a system call but a library routine that\ncalls poll().)\n\n\u003e \u003e Very few applications need the aio_* calls --- essentially only\n\u003e \u003e high-performance RDBMS servers even benefit from them at all, and\n\u003e \u003e most of those have been faking it fine for a while with multiple\n\u003e \u003e threads or processes.  This just provides a modicum of extra\n\u003e \u003e performance.\n\u003e \n\u003e Wrong, it makes a huge difference in even what I consider small programs.\n\nWhy don\u0027t you explain this in more detail?\n\n\u003e \u003e Although I don\u0027t have a copy of the spec handy, I think the aio_* APIs\n\u003e \u003e come from the POSIX spec IEEE Std 1003.1-1990, section 6.7.9, which is\n\u003e \u003e 13 years old, and which I think documented then-current practice.\n\u003e \u003e They might be even older than that.\n\u003e \n\u003e Yes, SGI has a patch to the linux kernel to implement the aio_ interfaces,\n\u003e but it\u0027s still not built in, who knows when it will be. The point is it\u0027s\n\u003e not portable in either case.\n\nYou originally said:\n\n  Could it be? After 20 years without this feature UNIX finally\n  catches up to Windows and has I/O that doesnt [sic] totally suck for\n  nontrivial apps? No way!\n\nThe point --- my point, the point I was discussing; please don\u0027t try\nto tell me you were trying to make a different point, because I don\u0027t\ncare --- is that you had no clue what you were talking about; Unix\nhasn\u0027t been without this feature, and in fact has had it since you\nwere in elementary school, and operating systems without it don\u0027t\n\"totally suck for nontrivial apps\".\n\nFor what it\u0027s worth, glibc has actually implemented the aio_* calls\nfor a while, just in a way that doesn\u0027t scale to large numbers of\nconcurrent I/O requests.  I find references to the glibc\nimplementation as far back as 1999 and glibc 2.1.1, and I could\nprobably find much earlier references if I had time:\nhttp://sources.redhat.com/ml/libc-hacker/1999-12/msg00070.html\n\n(more details at\nhttp://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/rgooch/linux/docs/io-events.html;\ndetails on the SGI patch are at\nhttp://oss.sgi.com/projects/kaio/faq.html)\n\n\u003e \u003e Unix has been multiprocess since 1969, and most Unix implementations\n\u003e \u003e have supported multithreading for a decade or more.\n\u003e \n\u003e And most UNIX is still kinda-sorta supporting the pthreads (POSIX)\n\u003e interface, each in their own 7/8 implementation. You\u0027re safe if you\n\u003e stick to the basics.\n\nYour original complaint was that Unix didn\u0027t do multithreading or\nmultiprogramming well.  Now that I\u0027ve pointed out how obviously\nidiotic that claim is, you\u0027ve amended your complaint: now, although\nindividual Unixes do these things well, you complain that their\nimplementations are not entirely conformant with the POSIX threads\nspecification.  Well, that\u0027s probably true, but I haven\u0027t written\npthreads programs in C much myself, so I can\u0027t confirm it from my own\nexperience.  But, even if it\u0027s true, it\u0027s not a very good reason to\nprefer Windows.\n\nI\u0027m sure you can provide examples of bugs in particular threading\nimplementations.  Spare us.

It took two hours to find her.\n\nALB\u003e \"The first day I went out with Wan, she came back to my hotel and hung all\nALB\u003e my clothes up and tidied the room. I thought it was marvelous,\" he said. \"I\nALB\u003e knew then there was something special.\"\n\nALB\u003e Moylan, 49, is one of thousands of men who use introduction agencies to meet\nALB\u003e -- and marry -- Thai women. He lives in England now with 28-year-old Wan,\nALB\u003e who is expecting their first child.\n\nALB\u003e Critics of marriage agencies say they exploit the grinding poverty of women\nALB\u003e in developing countries, offering dreams of a new life in the West that\nALB\u003e often turn sour. But Moylan says he has no regrets about coming to Thailand\nALB\u003e in search of a wife.\n\nALB\u003e \"I got to Thailand at 2 p.m., and by 4 p.m. I\u0027d met Wan,\" he said. \"I knew I\nALB\u003e found her attractive. I could tell straight away that she was very caring.\"\n\nALB\u003e Moylan spent a week in Thailand, and after returning to England kept in\nALB\u003e touch with Wan by phone and mail. Six months later she came to England and\nALB\u003e the couple married.\n\nALB\u003e MR. MARRIAGE\n\nALB\u003e Lawrence Lynch, 49, runs Thai Professional Introduction Services, the agency\nALB\u003e Moylan used to meet his wife. Lynch, who calls himself \"Mr. Marriage,\"\nALB\u003e started the company after also marrying a Thai woman through an introduction\nALB\u003e agency.\n\nALB\u003e Since then he has helped set up hundreds of marriages.\n\nALB\u003e \"In the last five years we\u0027ve done about 400,\" he said. \"To the best of my\nALB\u003e knowledge, they have all been successful.\"\n\nALB\u003e Male clients pay $2,213 for the service, although men from countries that\nALB\u003e require them to handle some of the visa work on their own get a discount.\nALB\u003e Clients then get to view catalogs and videos of hundreds of Thai women\nALB\u003e looking for a husband. If they like what they see they come to Bangkok.\n\nALB\u003e Clients are introduced to several women in chaperoned meetings in Lynch\u0027s\nALB\u003e office -- encounters that can often be awkward given mutual shyness and\nALB\u003e language problems.\n\nALB\u003e \"We find that the gentlemen are usually just as nervous as the ladies,\"\nALB\u003e Lynch said. \"But once they start meeting the ladies they soon relax.\"\n\nALB\u003e After the first meeting, couples can decide to go on dates to get to know\nALB\u003e each other better. Within two weeks of arrival, Lynch says, almost every\nALB\u003e client has found a potential wife.\n\nALB\u003e \"At the end of a fortnight it\u0027s very, very rare for a guy to go back and\nALB\u003e think he hasn\u0027t made his mind up,\" he said. In most cases, marriage follows,\nALB\u003e usually within the next year.\n\nALB\u003e Roongthip Kamchat, managing director of Thai No. 1 Connections, a\nALB\u003e Bangkok-based agency, says she has introduced about 1,000 couples, and less\nALB\u003e than 10 percent have broken up.\n\nALB\u003e Roongthip says she sometimes has a difficult time calming men who have just\nALB\u003e arrived in Bangkok looking for a wife.\n\nALB\u003e \"Sometimes they are very nervous,\" she said. \"And sometimes they are very\nALB\u003e impatient and say \u0027Give me a lady, I want to get married now.\u0027 I say: \u0027Calm\nALB\u003e down, OK, we\u0027ll talk.\"\u0027\n\nALB\u003e But if men are really in a hurry, Roongthip says, she can find them a wife\nALB\u003e and get them married within a week. Lynch says clients he has found wives\nALB\u003e for include a blind man, a man with one leg and a man with post-traumatic\nALB\u003e stress disorder.\n\nALB\u003e WHY?\n\nALB\u003e Similar marriage agencies can be found in many developing countries. Critics\nALB\u003e say they thrive on the neediness of lonely Western men who are unable to\nALB\u003e form relationships in their own country, and on the desperation of\nALB\u003e impoverished women who believe they can find a better life in the West.\n\nALB\u003e But Moylan says that if the arrangement makes both partners happy, there is\nALB\u003e no reason to object. \"If you talk about people who are needy, I think\nALB\u003e everybody wants someone to love them, and wants someone to love, so yes, I\nALB\u003e need Wan,\" he said.\n\nALB\u003e \"Thai women are dissatisfied with life in Thailand. I think there\u0027s no\nALB\u003e secret there. They are looking for a better life. I don\u0027t have a problem\nALB\u003e with that. In return they are willing to give a lot of love and care to\nALB\u003e their future husband.\"\n\nALB\u003e Lynch says men are dissatisfied with Western women too, and that is why they\nALB\u003e choose to use his agency.\n\nALB\u003e His brochure promises an alternative to the \"kind of de-feminized,\nALB\u003e over-sized, self-centered, mercenary-minded lady available on the British\nALB\u003e singles scene,\" and says he can make dreams come true even for men who are\nALB\u003e not \"God\u0027s gift to women.\"\n\nALB\u003e Roongthip said many Western men found it difficult to meet women in their\nALB\u003e own countries -- and found Thai women attractive.\n\nALB\u003e \"They don\u0027t know how to meet women. Even if they go to pubs or discotheques\nALB\u003e or restaurants or department stores, how can they ask people to marry them?\nALB\u003e Impossible,\" she said.\n\nALB\u003e \"Many Thai girls are slim, have long hair, black eyes, small nose. They are\nALB\u003e good at taking care and joking and laughing, not strict. Different from\nALB\u003e ladies from other countries.\"\n\nALB\u003e Although many couples married through agencies have a considerable age gap,\nALB\u003e the agencies say this is not a problem. They say language problems are also\nALB\u003e not a major obstacle.\n\nALB\u003e \"Thai ladies are not ageist, and they have no qualms whatsoever about having\nALB\u003e a husband who is significantly older,\" Lynch said. \"When I met my wife she\nALB\u003e couldn\u0027t speak a word of English. We muddled along with a phonetic\nALB\u003e dictionary. The ladies are very keen to learn English and they pick it up\nALB\u003e very quickly.\"\n\nALB\u003e Many agencies also offer tuition for woman on what to expect when they move\nALB\u003e to the West.\n\nALB\u003e \"We have kitchens, we have study classes,\" Roongthip said. \"We teach them\nALB\u003e how to eat, and when to make tea.\"\n\nALB\u003e PITFALLS\n\nALB\u003e But not all dreams come true. \"Bee\" is a 26-year-old Thai woman who went to\nALB\u003e Switzerland two years ago with a man she met through an agency. Now she is\nALB\u003e back in Bangkok, sad and angry.\n\nALB\u003e \"He had no friends, and I was so lonely,\" she said. \"I tried to make him\nALB\u003e happy but he just wanted sex and somebody to keep his house clean. He never\nALB\u003e spoke to me.\"\n\nALB\u003e Bee came back to Bangkok earlier this year. \"I thought I would be happy\nALB\u003e there,\" she said. \"But it was the worst time of my life.\"\n\nALB\u003e Lynch says that while some agencies are badly run, he makes checks to ensure\nALB\u003e unsuitable candidates are weeded out.\n\nALB\u003e \"We are ethical and professional,\" he said. \"We will not take on all\nALB\u003e comers.\"\n\nALB\u003e Moylan says that despite possible pitfalls, his own marriage is proof the\nALB\u003e arrangement can work. Wan\u0027s sister has just signed up with Lynch\u0027s company,\nALB\u003e looking for a foreign husband.\n\nALB\u003e \"Perhaps there are cases of women being exploited. I\u0027m sure there are,\"\nALB\u003e Moylan said. \"But in the majority of cases the women get a good deal.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n-- \nBest regards,\n bitbitch                            mailto:bitbitch@magnesium.net\n\n",

You also need\nvoltage you can use in a DC motor, which is why though the actual\ncapacitors in the system are charged to 2.5 volts, the system has them\narranged in series to boost the voltage.\n\nIgnore him.

They deliver them in an air-cooled, voltage\n\u003e regulated module that will charge to 42 V and hold 128 kilojoules -- roughly\n\u003e the energy in 2 teaspoons of sugar or a bite of a donut -- and weighs 16\n\u003e kilograms.  If that electrical energy could all be converted to kinetic\n\u003e energy, there\u0027s enough to get the capacitor module up to about 200 mph -- in\n\u003e a vacuum.\n\nSince the energy you can pack into a capacitor is something like\n1/2*C*(V^2), you want to design your system with the lowest voltage possible\nto fully exploit that V^2 ;) So yea, a 42V system will only be useful for\naccelerating insects, not cars. That must be why 40kV is standard not 42.\n(the joke of putting 42 into goggle to find that model was not missed BTW)\n\nMost production systems use a mix of batteries and capacitors, as very few\nreal world applications run for less then 10 seconds like the car we were\ntalking about originally. Even 10 seconds is pushing the \"capactior is the\nwrong choice\" limits. Thats why the landspeed record model is a battery one,\nit\u0027s got to run for a much longer period of time and needs a steady\ndischarge curve.\n\nBut it should be safe to say that most people want the Indy 500 version, not\nthe 1/4 mile sprint version when they are looking for a vehice :) For those\nyou dont want a battery or a capacitor, you want to take advantage of whole\natoms, not just electrons. Then you can suck off the electrons you need with\na fuel cell. However, you will use both capacitors for the braking/accel,\nand batteries to not just dump excess energy in the design.\n\n- Adam L. \"Duncan\" Beberg\n  http://www.mithral.com/~beberg/\n  beberg@mithral.com\n\n--- end forwarded text\n\n\n-- \n-----------------\nR.

For some messages, pictures do the job, but I would say not\n\u003enearly as often as words.  Why do you think Pictionary and Charades and\n\u003esuch are games?  Because images are usually not the most efficient way to\n\u003eget a message across.\n\u003e\n\u003e\u003emisc ramblings: i suppose you skeptical forkers would have said the same\n\u003e\u003ething about \u00271 hour photo\u0027 processing.  trivial, who needs it, i get better\n\u003e\u003eresultion elswhere.  and yet, it had great decentralizing impact - the\n\u003eplant\n\u003e\u003ehad to be downsized and pushed to the retail operation - the digital\n\u003ecamera,\n\u003e\u003eand finally the integrated digital camera phone brings this cycle of\n\u003e\u003edecentralization in photography to a logical conclusion (which will put the\n\u003e\u003ephoto giants to bed) and change the world in a meaningful way.  also, SMS\n\u003e\u003edidn\u0027t take off because its easy, it took off because it costs less.  its\n\u003e\u003egreatly ironic the carriers often trumpet the \u0027profitabilty\u0027 of their SMS\n\u003e\u003etraffic over others because of its ratio of cost to bandwidth.  in reality,\n\u003e\u003eSMS cannibilizes the voice rev\u0027s they bought their networks to handle.\n\u003e\n\u003eAgain, this is the same argument my colleague made (along with \"you just\n\u003edon\u0027t understand kids today, and they\u0027ll run with this\").  I wasn\u0027t saying\n\u003ethat MMS wouldn\u0027t take off because it wasn\u0027t high quality or that it wasn\u0027t\n\u003eeasy.  I was saying that I couldn\u0027t see why people would use it in a way\n\u003ethat \"changed the face of communications\".\n\u003e\n\u003eI\u0027m looking for the compelling reason (even if it\u0027s a stupid one) why\n\u003epeople would want to do this.  Sure, if they integrate cameras into the\n\u003ephone, and the quality improves (even only marginally) I can certainly see\n\u003epeople taking pictures with their cameras and occasionally sending them to\n\u003eother people.  But, mostly, I don\u0027t see what the benefit is to this over\n\u003esending them to someone\u0027s email address, or putting together an online (or\n\u003eoffline) photoalbum.\n\u003e\n\u003eI don\u0027t think 1 hour photos are trivial.  People want to see their own pics\n\u003eright away, and the quality is plenty good enough for snapshots.  That\u0027s\n\u003eone of the main reasons why digital cameras are catching on.  The instant\n\u003eview part.  I\u0027m guessing your argument is that people not only want\n\u003e\"instant view\", but also \"instant show\".  Which is what this service\n\u003eoffers.  I\u0027m not convinced that most people want \"instant show\".  I think\n\u003epeople like to package their pictures and show them.  That\u0027s why people put\n\u003etogether fancy albums, and sit there and force you to go through them while\n\u003ethey explain every picture.  Sure, occasionally \"instant show\" is nice, but\n\u003eit\u0027s just \"nice\" on occasion.  I still can\u0027t see how it becomes a integral\n\u003emessaging method.\n\u003e\n\u003eWhat\u0027s the specific benefit of taking a picture and immediately sending it\n\u003efrom one phone to another?  There has to be *some* benefit, even if it\u0027s\n\u003esilly if people are going to flock to it.\n\u003e\n\u003eI\u0027m searching... no one has given me a straight answer yet.\n\u003e\n\u003eThe *only* really intriguing idea I\u0027ve heard about things like MMS lately\n\u003eare Dan Gillmor\u0027s assertion that one day in the near future some news event\n\u003ewill happen, and a bunch of people will snap pictures with their mobile\n\u003ephones, from all different angles, and those photos tell the real story of\n\u003ewhat happened - before the press even gets there.\n\u003e\n\u003eWilling to be proven wrong,\n\u003eMike\n\u003e\n\u003ePS If the wireless carriers continue to price these services as stupidly as\n\u003ethey currently are, then MMS is *never* going to catch on.\n\n",

Because images are usually not the most efficient way to\n\u003eget a message across.\n\u003e\n\u003e\u003emisc ramblings: i suppose you skeptical forkers would have said the same\n\u003e\u003ething about \u00271 hour photo\u0027 processing.  trivial, who needs it, i get better\n\u003e\u003eresultion elswhere.  and yet, it had great decentralizing impact - the\n\u003eplant\n\u003e\u003ehad to be downsized and pushed to the retail operation - the digital\n\u003ecamera,\n\u003e\u003eand finally the integrated digital camera phone brings this cycle of\n\u003e\u003edecentralization in photography to a logical conclusion (which will put the\n\u003e\u003ephoto giants to bed) and change the world in a meaningful way.  also, SMS\n\u003e\u003edidn\u0027t take off because its easy, it took off because it costs less.  its\n\u003e\u003egreatly ironic the carriers often trumpet the \u0027profitabilty\u0027 of their SMS\n\u003e\u003etraffic over others because of its ratio of cost to bandwidth.  in reality,\n\u003e\u003eSMS cannibilizes the voice rev\u0027s they bought their networks to handle.\n\u003e\n\u003eAgain, this is the same argument my colleague made (along with \"you just\n\u003edon\u0027t understand kids today, and they\u0027ll run with this\").  I wasn\u0027t saying\n\u003ethat MMS wouldn\u0027t take off because it wasn\u0027t high quality or that it wasn\u0027t\n\u003eeasy.  I was saying that I couldn\u0027t see why people would use it in a way\n\u003ethat \"changed the face of communications\".\n\u003e\n\u003eI\u0027m looking for the compelling reason (even if it\u0027s a stupid one) why\n\u003epeople would want to do this.  Sure, if they integrate cameras into the\n\u003ephone, and the quality improves (even only marginally) I can certainly see\n\u003epeople taking pictures with their cameras and occasionally sending them to\n\u003eother people.  But, mostly, I don\u0027t see what the benefit is to this over\n\u003esending them to someone\u0027s email address, or putting together an online (or\n\u003eoffline) photoalbum.\n\u003e\n\u003eI don\u0027t think 1 hour photos are trivial.  People want to see their own pics\n\u003eright away, and the quality is plenty good enough for snapshots.  That\u0027s\n\u003eone of the main reasons why digital cameras are catching on.  The instant\n\u003eview part.  I\u0027m guessing your argument is that people not only want\n\u003e\"instant view\", but also \"instant show\".  Which is what this service\n\u003eoffers.  I\u0027m not convinced that most people want \"instant show\".  I think\n\u003epeople like to package their pictures and show them.  That\u0027s why people put\n\u003etogether fancy albums, and sit there and force you to go through them while\n\u003ethey explain every picture.  Sure, occasionally \"instant show\" is nice, but\n\u003eit\u0027s just \"nice\" on occasion.  I still can\u0027t see how it becomes a integral\n\u003emessaging method.\n\u003e\n\u003eWhat\u0027s the specific benefit of taking a picture and immediately sending it\n\u003efrom one phone to another?  There has to be *some* benefit, even if it\u0027s\n\u003esilly if people are going to flock to it.\n\u003e\n\u003eI\u0027m searching... no one has given me a straight answer yet.\n\u003e\n\u003eThe *only* really intriguing idea I\u0027ve heard about things like MMS lately\n\u003eare Dan Gillmor\u0027s assertion that one day in the near future some news event\n\u003ewill happen, and a bunch of people will snap pictures with their mobile\n\u003ephones, from all different angles, and those photos tell the real story of\n\u003ewhat happened - before the press even gets there.\n\u003e\n\u003eWilling to be proven wrong,\n\u003eMike\n\u003e\n\u003ePS If the wireless carriers continue to price these services as stupidly as\n\u003ethey currently are, then MMS is *never* going to catch on.\n\n",

As long as\n\u003e current fads don\u0027t involve in-vivo rewrite of the genome, homeoboxes\n\u003e including (now there\u0027s a problem for you, homeoboxing the adult), they\u0027re\n\u003e not all that smart an idear.\n\nI forgot what we were taking about.  (:\n\n\u003e  \n\u003e \u003e Actualy our silly antiquated ideas about relationships and love have\n\u003e \u003e resulted in the bleedings of many upon many a page (and musical\n\u003e \u003e instrumnet, and canvas)  What\u0027s the problem if we dash a little Mrs.\n\u003e \n\u003e Art is sure nice. However, if art is our first priority we\u0027re kinda\n\u003e fux0red, if we\u0027ve set our sight on a sustainable culture.\n\nNah, didn\u0027t say art\u0027s our priority.  Said our ideas about relationships \nand love are.  \n\n\u003e \u003e And let me tell you this: just because a child happens to be\n\u003e \u003e single-parented (what a word), does not mean that child is\n\u003e \u003e dysfunctional or lives in a dysfunctional home.  The govt/media/church\n\u003e \n\u003e Our firmware is not built to be single-parented. You can counteract that\n\u003e somewhat by exposing the kid to a community of close friends, but not too\n\u003e many do that.\n\nI see it a lot in the south. Also family.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e \u003e has tried to make it look like there is a disintegration, when in\n\u003e \u003e fact, there is a coming together of other family members and friends\n\u003e \u003e to raise children.  It\u0027s not decaying -- it\u0027s changing.  Nothing wrong\n\u003e \u003e with change.\n\u003e \n\u003e I don\u0027t know what exactly is wrong, but something is definitely wrong.  \n\u003e This is way too important to be left to just our intuition of what is\n\u003e right and what is wrong.\n\nOne thing that\u0027s wrong is who some of us choose as babysitters.  Too many \nkids are put in front of the television for hours each day, to be \ninfluenced by what the media and government thinks is important.  I \nlearned a long time ago that what they think is important and what is are \ntwo different things.  I threw the TV out when Xi was 9.  She\u0027s got her \nown place now, and still doesn\u0027t have one.  YaY!  Another thing that\u0027s \nwrong is what goes on in public schools.  Some allow a bit of \nindividuality, but only for a class or a short period of time, depending \non the teachers, most of the time.  I dunno how many times I\u0027ve seen Xi \ncome home from school absolutely miserable or outraged about something \nthat happened at school.  She made it to college, though, whew.  It\u0027s a \nbig problem to tackle, and I don\u0027t know the answer.  I like the idea of \nthe voucher system, because in a way it is a way parents can vote more \nefficiently for how their kids are taught.\n\n \n\u003e   \u003e \u003e \u003e At least from the viewpoint of demographics sustainability and\n\u003e \u003e \u003e counterpressure to gerontocracy and resulting innovatiophobia we\u0027re doing\n\u003e \u003e \u003e something wrong.\n\u003e \u003e \u003e \n\u003e \u003e \u003e Maybe we should really go dirty Tleilaxu all the way.\n\u003e \u003e \u003e \n\u003e \u003e \n\u003e \u003e Maybe y\u0027all should buy m-w some more bandwidth.\n\u003e \n\u003e m-w?\n\u003e \nmerriam-webster.

And the bandwidth shadows in most cities\nare surprisingly large and common.  They aren\u0027t selling the software, which\nis pretty pricy as it happens.  They are using it to optimize next\ngeneration wireless canopies over metro areas and fiber networks on a large\nscale.  There are an essentially infinite number of metro wireless\nconfigurations, some of which generate far more dead or marginal spots and\nothers which are very expensive to operate (due to backhaul transit\nconsiderations) or both.  This software can be used as a tool to optimize\nthe canopy coverage and minimize the actual transit costs since the wireless\nis tied into fiber at multiple points.\n\nThe canopies we are talking about aren\u0027t short-range wifi technologies, but\na mixture of long-range high-performance wireless networking, with bandwidth\nmeasured in tens to hundreds of mbits and ranges measured in miles (up to\nwell over a hundred miles on the extreme end).  At those ranges and\nbandwidth levels, the cost of providing the network can easily vary by an\norder of magnitude or more depending on how you manage RF shadows and\nproximity to fiber access points.  The idea ultimately is to optimize the\ncost and performance such that no existing network infrastructure providers\ncan remotely compete and maintain profitability.  This is a surprisingly low\nbar, and it is about time networks were designed with this level of\nlarge-scale optimization (cost per mbit, maximizing coverage, and effective\nbandwidth available per unit area) in any case.  And for this company\u0027s\nlong-term plans, this type of capability will be absolutely necessary to\nkeep things sane.\n\nOr at least investors find this capability very sexy and compelling,\nespecially since we have this lovely visualization engine tied into the\nsystem (CLI batches never have the same effect, even if it is more\nefficient).\n\n-James Rogers\n jamesr@best.com\n\n",

The cover page should contain the\npaper title, and the name, affiliation, address, phone number, fax\nnumber, and e-mail address of each author. The second page should\nstart with the paper title at the top and be immediately followed by\nthe abstract. Except on the cover page, the authors\u0027 names and\naffiliations must NOT appear in the manuscript. The abstract of 100-\n150 words should clearly summarise the objectives and content of the\nmanuscript. Submitted manuscript should normally be 4000-6000 words\nlong; longer ones will be considered but may be subject to editorial\nrevision.\n\nSubmission of a paper implies that its content is original and that\nit has not been published previously, and that it is not under\nconsideration for publication elsewhere. Yet, significantly extended\npapers previously presented at conferences may be acceptable.\n\nFor more information please see\nhttp://www-i4.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/~jakobs/standards_journal/journal_home.html\n\nor visit the publisher\u0027s web site at\nhttp://www.idea-group.com/journals/details.asp?id\u003d497\n\n\nImportant Dates for the Inaugural Issue:\n\nSubmission Deadline for Issue 2:   October 1, 2002\nNotification of Acceptance:        December 1, 2002\nCamera-ready Paper Due:            January 15, 2003\n\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\n\nKai Jakobs\n\nTechnical University of Aachen\nComputer Science Department\nInformatik IV (Communication and Distributed Systems)\nAhornstr. 55, D-52074 Aachen, Germany\nTel.: +49-241-80-21405\nFax:  +49-241-80-22220\nKai.Jakobs@i4.informatik.rwth-aachen.de\nhttp://www-i4.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/~jakobs/kai/kai_home.html\n\n\n**********************************************************************\nFor Listserv Instructions, see http://www.lawlists.net/cyberia\nOff-Topic threads: http://www.lawlists.net/mailman/listinfo/cyberia-ot\nNeed more help?

    "message": "\nHere are numbers that come from a study of a couple of thousand swedes, with \nno reference to sexual preference that I could find. The point would seem to \nbe that (1) sexual activity follows a power curve, with a few people, a la \nWilt Chamberlain, having an extaordinarily large number of sexual contacts, \nev en in a short period of time and (2) a tendency for men to have more \npartners than women.  I have no idea, being a statistical ignoramus, whether \nthe fact that there seem to be more men than women at the extremely \npromiscuous end of the sex-partners-distribution curve means that you\u0027d get \neven more extreme results in a group of men who chiefly have sex with other \nmen. \n\n\nhttp://polymer.bu.edu/~amaral/Sex_partners/Content_sex.html\n\n\u003c\u003cFor example, the mean number of partners since sexual initiation for women \nis approximately 7 and in a sample of less than 1500 Swedish women we find an \nindividual with 100 partners. For men, the mean is approximately 15 and we \nfind an individual with 800 partners, which is almost 50 times larger than \nthe mean! So, somehow Don Juan was not such an extraordinary case but just \none data point in a wide spectrum of behaviors that can be observed. \u003e\u003e\n\n\nAs for gay men: There is indeed anecdotal evidence of cases of extreme \npromiscuity among gay men. You can read about it in Randy Schiltz\u0027s And the \nBand Played On. He writes about  bathhouse culture pre-HIV; he also discusses \nhow, in the gay politics of the time, there was a sub-culture of what you \nmight call radical gay men who argued (and acted on the argument) that having \nmany partners was an essential part of what being gay actually was. It was an \nexplicitly political statement: monogamy is an artifact of straight culture.\n    That view seems to have died, in more ways than one. Part of the point of \nSchiltz\u0027s book was to condemn the role that it and  bathhouse culture played \nin spreading the AIDs epidemic that eventually killed Schiltz, among so many \nothers. This doesn\u0027t let Eugen off the hook--but it is accurate to say that \nthere was a  cult of promiscuity that was particular to the gay community.\n\nTom\n\n",

(yes, Aavid or such makes some as a standard part.)\n      I prefer to include the heatpipe but employ the radiative\n  mass in elevating the laptop (i.e. in the form of a catch-handle\n  and second logo device behind the laptop, which generally\n  provides stow and attachment for elevation legs (move them\n  out farther to get to the next-higher ekevation, until the sides\n  of the laptop are met.)  This also happens to provide a little\n  protection for USB 2  and 1394 cables that I tend to keep\n  plugged in all the time (a bit longer port life? Please.) \n\n3- A case color other than brown or black, and preferably (if the\n    display module NRE is entirely permissive) the capability to\n    -run with the backlight off.-  Again, to save battery power, but\n    also as a feature; maybe you remember the iBooks modified\n   in this manner.  The user has the privilege to pull out the\n   backlight diffuser and fiberoptic lightpipe/CF assembly, with\n   its backreflector, and the whole warrantee.  This provides\n   for excellent outdoor use, often with the diffuser reinserted\n   to keep depth-of-field distractions minimised.\n     What would I like?  A1200 putty color, any translucency,\n   in or over a rosewood-colored (in KDE color browser, I see\n   chocolate, firebrick and a couple of \u0027indian red\u0027 that are great\n   candidates) base.  \n      I would also like to be able to at least turn off the backlight\n    without closing the lid, and to be -able- to fit an -external-\n    light source such as a UV-filtered solar collector (and glare\n    hood) to feed\n    into the backlight.  Not only does this make an excellent \n    color environment but lets one work outdoors tolerably.\n      The logo should be a coloration of a\n   minimal surface, as the MAA is trying to get me to renew\n   with:  demos at http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/pbourke/geometry/\n   at first blush.  We\u0027ll see what comes out of the contest and\n   maybe you\u0027ll like the mapping MathCAD does of the\n   logo to a minimal surface or manifold that reflects the\n   openness of AmigaOS, Ami* and Amiga community.\n   MAA.org has more references, I\u0027m sure.\n\n4- Obviously Elfin details., e,g, the backlight inlet.\n\nOther details:\nUSB2.x preferred; FireWire would be needed if that\u0027s unavailable.\nOptions like 802.11b or attabhable WiFi hub for ethernet port\nshould round out the offering.  An option for just-released \n.13 micron P4 (with mobile power features) could make more\nreviewers greenlight the series; much better power consumption,\nand almost certainly a higher a top clock come with that.\nCompactFlash, SmartMedia and MMC flash memory card\ninterfaces would be very pleasant.  I\u0027ve mentioned booting to\nUSB, and booting from CF would be a pleasant extigency also.\nTo that end, a backup solution with compression using\nUSB 2 storage or the multimode drive is always a nice \nbundle item; that or a chance to back out a patch under 3 OS.....\n\n\nBlue skies (and clear water and fresh air): \nWaterproof to 30 feet, 3 Ethernet ports plus onboard WiFi.\nSvelte; 3-line frontpanel LCD and bright red pager LED,\nbuiltin G4 cellphone functions, choice of side and \nfrontpanel trim: Ivory-like stuff inscribed with M68k memory map\nand various OS 3.9 structures or textured fur that\nsays \u0027This is Amiga Speaking\u0027 when stroked \u0027round. \nDecent keyboard, as in Toshiba or IBM laptops; perhaps \nan ergonomic fingerworks.com device (they work as \nkeyboard and mouse) as the keyboard/trackpad.\n2 Directional planar mics atop AMLCD; soundcard with multiple \n18 bit A-D and noise reduction DSP that work in our\n(second-through-fourth, at least) favorite OS.\nActual 7\" bellows pulls out at nominal ventilation \nfan location for real void-comp (the test in Blade\nRunner) style cooling and extended bass; active cooling\nand airfiltering is available to adjust humidity at user\nseat and provide mineral water.\nHyperTransport ports.\n\n",

    "message": "\nThis article from NYTimes.com \nhas been sent to you by khare@alumni.caltech.edu.\n\n\nSure does explain FoRK :-)\n\nnot yet abandoned,\n  Rohit\n\nkhare@alumni.caltech.edu\n\n\nSome Friends, Indeed, Do More Harm Than Good\n\nSeptember 10, 2002\nBy MARY DUENWALD \n\n\n\n\n \n\nFriends are supposed to be good for you. In recent years,\nscientific research has suggested that people who have\nstrong friendships experience less stress, they recover\nmore quickly from heart attacks and they are likely to live\nlonger than the friendless. They are even less susceptible\nto the common cold, studies show. \n\nBut not all friends have such a salutary effect. Some lie,\ninsult and betray. Some are overly needy. Some give too\nmuch advice. Psychologists and sociologists are now calling\nattention to the negative health effects of bad friends. \n\n\"Friendship is often very painful,\" said Dr. Harriet\nLerner, a psychologist and the author of \"The Dance of\nConnection.\" \"In a close, enduring friendship, jealousy,\nenvy, anger and the entire range of difficult emotions will\nrear their heads. One has to decide whether the best thing\nis to consider it a phase in a long friendship or say this\nis bad for my health and I\u0027m disbanding it.\" \n\nAnother book, \"When Friendship Hurts,\" by Dr. Jan Yager, a\nsociologist at the University of Connecticut at Stamford,\nadvises deliberately leaving bad friends by the wayside.\n\"There\u0027s this myth that friendships should last a\nlifetime,\" Dr. Yager said. \"But sometimes it\u0027s better that\nthey end.\" \n\nThat social scientists would wait until now to spotlight\nthe dangers of bad friends is understandable, considering\nthat they have only recently paid close attention to\nfriendship at all. Marriage and family relationships -\nbetween siblings or parents and children - have been seen\nas more important. \n\nOf course, troubled friendships are far less likely to lead\nto depression or suicide than troubled marriages are. And\nchildren are seldom seriously affected when friendships go\nbad. \n\nAs a popular author of relationship advice books, Dr.\nLerner said, \"Never once have I had anyone write and say my\nbest friend hits me.\" \n\nDr. Beverley Fehr, a professor of psychology at the\nUniversity of Winnipeg, noted that sociological changes,\nlike a 50 percent divorce rate, have added weight to the\nrole of friends in emotional and physical health. \n\n\"Now that a marital relationship can\u0027t be counted on for\nstability the way it was in the past, and because people\nare less likely to be living with or near extended family\nmembers, people are shifting their focus to friendships as\na way of building community and finding intimacy,\" said Dr.\nFehr, the author of \"Friendship Processes.\" \n\nUntil the past couple of years, the research on friendship\nfocused on its health benefits. \"Now we\u0027re starting to look\nat it as a more full relationship,\" said Dr. Suzanna Rose,\na professor of psychology at Florida International\nUniversity in Miami. \"Like marriage, friendship also has\nnegative characteristics.\" \n\nThe research is in its infancy. Psychologists have not yet\nmeasured the ill effects of bad friendship, Dr. Fehr said.\nSo far they have only, through surveys and interviews,\nfigured out that it is a significant problem. The early\nresearch, Dr. Fehr added, is showing that betrayal by a\nfriend can be more devastating than experts had thought. \n\nHow can a friend be bad? Most obviously, Dr. Rose said, by\ndrawing a user into criminal or otherwise ill-advised\npursuit. \"When you think of people who were friends at\nEnron,\" she added, \"you can see how friendship can support\nantisocial behavior.\" \n\nBetrayal also makes for a bad friendship. \"When friends\nsplit up,\" said Dr. Keith E. Davis, a professor of\npsychology at the University of South Carolina, \"it is\noften in cases where one has shared personal information or\nsecrets that the other one wanted to be kept confidential.\"\n\n\nAnother form of betrayal, Dr. Yager said, is when a friend\nsuddenly turns cold, without ever explaining why. \"It\u0027s\nmore than just pulling away,\" she said. \"The silent\ntreatment is actually malicious.\" \n\nAt least as devastating is an affair with the friend\u0027s\nromantic partner, as recently happened to one of Dr.\nLerner\u0027s patients. \"I would not encourage her to hang in\nthere and work this one out,\" Dr. Lerner said. \n\nA third type of bad friendship involves someone who insults\nthe other user, Dr. Yager said. One of the 180 people who\nresponded to Dr. Yager\u0027s most recent survey on friendship\ndescribed how, when she was 11, her best friend called her\n\"a derogatory name.\" The woman, now 32, was so devastated\nthat she feels she has been unable to be fully open with\npeople ever since, Dr. Yager said. \n\nEmotional abuse may be less noticeable than verbal abuse,\nbut it is \"more insidious,\" Dr. Yager said. \"Some people\nconstantly set up their friends,\" she explained. \"They\u0027ll\nhave a party, not invite the friend, but make sure he or\nshe finds out.\" \n\nRisk takers, betrayers and abusers are the most extreme\nkinds of bad friends, Dr. Yager said, but they are not the\nonly ones. She identifies 21 different varieties. Occupying\nthe second tier of badness are the liar, the user who is\noverly dependent, the friend who never listens, the user\nwho meddles too much in a friend\u0027s life, the competitor and\nthe loner, who prefers not to spend time with friends. \n\nMost common is the promise breaker. \"This includes everyone\nfrom the user who says let\u0027s have a cup of coffee but\nsomething always comes up at the last minute to someone who\npromises to be there for you when you need them, but then\nisn\u0027t,\" Dr. Yager said. \n\nSome friendships go bad, as some romantic relationships do,\nwhen one of the people gradually or suddenly finds reasons\nto dislike the other one. \n\n\"With couples, it can take 18 to 24 months for someone to\ndiscover there\u0027s something important they don\u0027t like about\nthe other user,\" said Dr. Rose of Florida International.\n\"One might find, for example, that in subtle ways the other\nuser is a racist. In friendships, which are less intense,\nit may take even more time for one user to meet the\nother\u0027s dislike criteria.\" \n\nWhether a friendship is worth saving, Dr. Lerner said,\n\"depends on how large the injury is.\" \n\n\"Sometimes the mature thing is to lighten up and let\nsomething go,\" she added. \"It\u0027s also an act of maturity\nsometimes to accept another user\u0027s limitations.\"\n\nAcceptance should come easier among friends than among\nspouses, Dr. Lerner said, because people have more than one\nfriend and do not need a full range of emotional support\nfrom each one. \n\nBut if the friendship has deteriorated to the point where\none friend truly dislikes the other one or finds that the\nfriendship is causing undue stress, the healthy response is\nto pull away, Dr. Yager said, to stop sharing the personal\nor intimate details of life, and start being too busy to\nget together, ever. \n\n\"It takes two people to start and maintain a friendship,\nbut only one to end it,\" Dr. Yager said. \n\nFriendship, because it is voluntary and unregulated, is far\neasier to dissolve than marriage. But it is also\ncomparatively fragile, experts say. Ideally, the loss of a\nbad friendship should leave a user with more time and\nappreciation for good ones, Dr. Lerner said. \n\n\"It is wise to pay attention to your friendships and have\nthem in order while you\u0027re healthy and your life and work\nare going well,\" she said. \"Because when a crisis hits,\nwhen someone you love dies, or you lose your job and your\nhealth insurance, when the universe gives you a crash\ncourse in vulnerability, you will discover how crucial and\nlife-preserving good friendship is.\"\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/10/health/psychology/10FRIE.html?ex\u003d1032684795\u0026ei\u003d1\u0026en\u003d2a88a6d1b985c977\n\n\n\nHOW TO ADVERTISE\n---------------------------------\nFor information on advertising in e-mail newsletters \nor other creative advertising opportunities with The \nNew York Times on the Web, please contact\nonlinesales@nytimes.com or visit our online media \nkit at http://www.nytimes.com/adinfo\n\nFor general information about NYTimes.com, write to \nhelp@nytimes.com.  \n\nCopyright 2002 The New York Times Company\n\n",

Any CGI script, Java servlet, ASP component, etc. could be\nrun on the client. This is like breaking the Web server into two parts.\nOriginally, Web servers just understood HTTP and sent pages. Then the field\nstarted demanding more from the Web and the servers got loaded down with CGI\nand mod_perl and active pages and stuff. So now the Web server can choose to\ngo back to simple serving and (where the application is appropriate) let the\nclient do the other razzamatazz. This is superior to JavaScript in one\nimportant detail: the program doesn\u0027t have to reload when a new page is\nloaded, as JavaScript functions do.\n\nAnd because XDegrees uses Web-compatible technology, users can access\nXDegrees resources without installing any software, simply by using their\nbrowser.\"\n\n\u003d\u003d\u003d\n\"Scaling is the main question that comes to mind when somebody describes a\nnew naming and searching system. CEO Michael Tanne claims to have figured\nout mathematically that the system can scale up to millions of users and\nbillions of resources. Scaling is facilitated by the careful location of\nservers (XDegrees will colocate servers at key routing points, as Akamai\ndoes), and by directing clients to the nearest server as their default\n\"home\" server.

    "message": "\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\nHash: SHA1\n\nSay \u0027amen\u0027 somebody. What the WSJ said, appended below.\n\n\nThe WTC, as constructed, was a confiscatory government boondoggle,\nexpropriated from the original pre-construction property owners at\nthe behest of a third-generation trust-fund-aristocrat for the \"good\"\nof the city, and owned by an \"authority\" looking for something else\nto do after it, and its coach-hounds in organized labor and organized\ncrime, had killed what was the largest port in the world\u0027s richest\nnation.\n\nNow, of course, it\u0027s about to get worse. The sins of 40 years ago\nhave been compounded at the hands of two kinds of literally\nirrational fanatics, first those in religion, and now those in\ngovernment.\n\nAs a result, a large part of 10 million square feet of once perfectly\nusable office space, devoted, at least ostensibly, to commerce, will\nbe \"granted\" away  in a potlatch that only government, and\nspecial-interest \"communities\", (or \"stakeholders\", or whatever the\ncryptosocialist psycho-rabble call themselves this week) can organize\nto such perfection.\n\n\nAll this in probably the *only* city in the country that was founded\nby a *business*, explicitly for the purpose of *commerce*. Not\nreligious fanaticism. Not colonial expansion in a monarch\u0027s name.\n*Commerce*.\n\n\nIf they *really* wanted to make a point to the superstitious luddites\nwho collapsed those buildings (using probably the only sharp objects\non a plane full of government-disarmed passengers) the so-called\n\"authority\" should disband itself and sell its property off to the\nhighest bidder and let the *market* -- the cure to all luddism,\nforeign and domestic, government and superstitious -- decide.\n\nIf the new, *private* owner wants to sell, or give away, a space for\na memorial, fine. They could sell tickets and donate the money to the\nfamilies of the dead and injured. Probably great for marketing the\nproperty, at least during the lifetime of anyone who remembers the\nevent.\n\nAnd, of course, if the new owner wants to build something twice as\ntall, or with twice as much space than the original 10 million square\nfeet, splendid. Whatever the market will bear.\n\n\nIn these days of increasingly ubiquitous trans-national geodesic\ninternetworks, of strong financial cryptography, and of exponentially\ndecreasing transaction costs in formerly monolithic industries,\neconomics and freedom can, and will, prevail over both superstition\nand statism.\n\nIt\u0027s probably too much to hope for an actual market in lower\nManhattan mega-real-estate to prevail this early in the game, but\nit\u0027s going to happen sooner or later.\n\nAnd, whenever it does, *that* will be a fitting memorial to those who\ndied at the World Trade Center.\n\nCheers,\nRAH\n\n- -------\n\nhttp://online.wsj.com/article_print/0,,SB1031705210159756235,00.html\n\n\nThe Wall Street Journal\n\nSeptember 11, 2002\nREVIEW \u0026 OUTLOOK\n\nA Living Memorial\n\nAs we write these words, we can look down from our offices into the\nsix-story crater where the Twin Towers once stood. Like everyone\nelse, we want that site to be rebuilt in a way that honors those who\ndied a year ago. But we also think the best memorial to those who\nperished would be a living one.\n\nThe site of the World Trade Center calls forth many emotions,\nespecially today: anger, grief and respect for the many acts of\nheroism that took place there. But underlying it all is the memory of\nthe enormous vitality that distinguished the towers before they were\nattacked and was a large reason they were targeted. The best\nexpression of the spirit of New York and of those who died would be\nto once again see thousands of people from dozens of countries\nworking, meeting, shopping, eating -- that is, engaged in the sort of\nproductive work and play that used to take place there. Osama bin\nLaden should not be allowed to have turned it into a cemetery.\n\nBut restoring this memory is not what the discussion in New York has\nbeen about. So far no one is talking seriously about the vigorous\nrebuilding of downtown Manhattan, which lost 100,000 jobs when the\nTrade Center fell. Instead the discussion centers on the size and\nscale of the memorial, and on satisfying every political interest now\nclamoring for a piece of the action. New York\u0027s political leadership,\nand its financial and media elites, are squandering a historic chance\nto rebuild a better, more prosperous city.\n\nThis is in part the fault of the commission tasked with figuring out\nwhat to do with the site. In consultation with New York Governor\nGeorge Pataki, who is thinking primarily about his own November\nre-election, the commission made the decision to focus first on the\nmemorial. The Manhattan Institute\u0027s Steve Malanga argues that the\ncommission would have been better off setting aside a limited space\nfor the memorial, getting on with the rebuilding and then returning\nto the memorial. This is in essence what the Pentagon has so\nsuccessfully done -- rebuild immediately and set aside two acres for\nan outdoor memorial, a design for which has yet to be decided.\n\nA big part of the problem in New York is that the city\u0027s\nanti-development activists know an opening when they see one. They\nwant the World Trade Center site -- and even some surrounding areas\n- -- transformed into an enormous park. These political advocates have\nhad plenty of practice at turning proposed development projects in\nNew York into a nightmare of delay and litigation, and the World\nTrade Center site is now getting the same treatment. Worse, they are\ncynically using some bereaved family members to advance their own\nanti-development agenda in the name of \"honoring\" the dead. One\nfamily group even called a press conference to reject as\ndisrespectful a proposed train line under the site.\n\nWe are not experts in designing war memorials, but we\u0027re confident\nthat a gigantic park in the heart of the world\u0027s financial center\nisn\u0027t the appropriate choice for those who died a year ago. The great\ncities of Europe and Japan, devastated in World War II, have all\nrebuilt, and with memorials that are integrated into modern urban\nlife. Perhaps the most powerful is found in Rotterdam, the Dutch port\ncity reduced to rubble by German bombing, where survivors erected a\nstatue of a man with a hole where his heart used to be.\n\nIn this country, the practice has been for the names of war dead to\nbe inscribed on the walls of institutions with which they were\naffiliated. If you walk into Nassau Hall at Princeton University,\nyou\u0027ll find the names of 644 alumni who died in the Revolutionary\nWar, the War of 1812, the Civil War, the Spanish-American War, World\nWar I, World War II, Korea and Southeast Asia. No one thinks it\ndisrespectful to the dead that the life of the university goes on\naround the walls containing their names.\n\nIn New York now, it would help if political leaders looked beyond the\nemotional tug of the victims and their families to the city\u0027s future.\nRudolph Giuliani, now that he\u0027s out office, wants the entire 16 acres\ndevoted to the memorial. Governor Pataki has called for no structures\non the \"footprints,\" which, being in the center of the site, would\nseverely curtail options. Mayor Michael Bloomberg initially raised\nhis voice in favor of commercial development but was bloodied by the\npress and has since ducked for cover.\n\nMaybe things will be different after this anniversary is past. Maybe\nthose responsible for the World Trade Center site will start thinking\nmore about the next 50 or 100 years than the past 12 months. The best\nway to honor the dead is by reviving normal life and commerce.\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: PGP 7.5\n\niQA/AwUBPX9zD8PxH8jf3ohaEQI2aACgv7mtb5VKTpRj5MJQt1OyzyifzusAn273\nfgNkOntna6+SmLO8TB4XYbC2\n\u003d09az\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n-- \n-----------------\nR.

I believe a suitable memorial\nsurrounded by a lovely park with benches, walkways,\nchildren\u0027s playgrounds, possibly some concessions such\nas a restaurant, small theater and a place for art works\nwould be the best tribute to those who lost their lives.\nWhat do you think should done with the space?\n\nJoe Adams\nHillsdale, New Jersey\n\nI dread the thought of a big memorial in Manhattan\nthat\u0027s designed by committee and that\u0027s gone through\npublic hearings and so forth ----- it\u0027s going to be cold\nand ugly and pretentious and the upshot will be one more\npublic space that the public hates, of which there are\nplenty already. New York is a bustling commercial city\nand that\u0027s the beauty of it, it\u0027s a city of young\nambitious dreamy people, like the folks who died in the\ntowers, and it\u0027s not a memorializing city. Historic\nevents occurred in New York that in any other city would\nbe commemorated with interpretive centers and guides and\nhistorical museums and in New York there\u0027s barely a\nlittle plaque. That\u0027s a great thing, in my estimation.\nIt\u0027s a hustling city, full of immigrants looking for\ntheir big chance, and compared to that spirit of\nentrepreneurship, a memorial plaza with a fountain and a\nstatue of something seems dead to me. Look at Grant\u0027s\nTomb. Who walks past it and thinks about President\nGrant? Nobody. People sit in the plaza by Grant\u0027s Tomb\nand think about lunch, about sex, about money, about all\nthe things that New York is about. If you want to find\nGrant, read his memoirs. His monument seems odd in New\nYork: it belongs in Washington, which is our memorial\ncity. New York is for the young and lively.\n\n\n",

Ricco..who knows, maybe some\nheat time would be good for him as a single.\n\nAll this of course at a time when the ratting are in the bottom of a 4\nyear valley of gloom, the last 2 years have been mostly squandered on\nborken story arc promises and bad acting, and to top it all off Mick is no\nlonger ont he sceen so...bang bang...how can it be all good?\n\nWell, its back to my growing ECW divx collection where Tajiri was the shiz\nand Mick cut promos unrivaled by any of todays mic monkeys.\n\n* Todays managers are a far cry form the managers of the 80\u0027s/early 90\u0027s.\nRicco is nota  Paul Bearer or a Jimmy Heart at all but more like a buddy\nwho goes to the ring with them and occasional interferes..ugh.\n\n\n\n",

This leads to the point that religion and less \nsophisticated societies are a dangerous mix.  It also tends to invoke \nthe image of extremes that might occur without diligent maintenance of \nsociety.\nC) Many splinter Christianity religions have \u0027clean hands\u0027 but they also \naren\u0027t \u0027found in the wild\u0027.\n\n(By \"primitive expression\", I don\u0027t mean to slight any society, but that \nthere is some chronic evidence of irrational mob actions and uncivilized \nbehavior (killing infants, women to break religious blue laws, etc.). \n The US has only really been mostly free of \"primitive expression\" for \n40-50 years, although large categories, including serious religious \nconflict, were settled quite a while ago.)\n\nD) The Northern Ireland Protestant vs. Catholic feud, recently more or \nless concluded, is not completely unlike this kind of friction generated \nby splitting society too much along religious lines.  One Post article \npointed out that the problem basically stemmed from the vertical \nintegration of areas along religious lines all the way to schools, \ngovernment, political party, etc.  (Of course both cases have a heritage \nof British conquest, but who doesn\u0027t?)\n\n(I couldn\u0027t find the article I remember, but here are a couple of others:)\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename\u003darticle\u0026node\u003d\u0026contentId\u003dA33761-2001Jul8\u0026notFound\u003dtrue\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename\u003darticle\u0026node\u003d\u0026contentId\u003dA15956-2002Jul16\u0026notFound\u003dtrue\n\n\u0027Northern Ireland is a British province of green valleys and \ncloud-covered hills whose 1.6 million people are politically and \nreligiously divided. About 54 percent of the population is Protestant, \nand most Protestants are unionists who want the province to remain part \nof Britain. The Roman Catholic minority is predominantly republican, or \nnationalist; they want to merge with the Republic of Ireland to the south.\n\n\nIn 1968, Catholic leaders launched a civil rights drive modeled on the \nRev. Martin Luther King Jr.\u0027s campaign in the American South. But \nviolence quickly broke out, with ancient religious animosities fueling \nthe political argument. Armed paramilitary groups sprung up on both \nsides. Police records and historians agree that the most lethal group by \nfar was the IRA, fighting on the Catholic side with a goal of a united \nIreland\n\nThe provincial police force estimates that about 3,600 people were \nkilled during the 30-year conflict known, with characteristic Northern \nIreland understatement, as \"The Troubles.\"\u0027\n\n\u003e2. The US is trying to avoid making war on the Muslim religion.\n\u003e\nThat\u0027s fine, as it would be an inappropriate concentration.

We ask it, in the spirit of love, of Him Who is the\nSource of Love, and Who is the ever-faithful refuge and friend of all that\nare sore beset and seek His aid with humble and contrite hearts. Amen.\"\n\nTwain wrote the story, \"The War Prayer,\" in 1905 during the American\noccupation of the Philippines, but the story wasn\u0027t printed until 1923,\nthirteen years after his death, because the editors thought it \"unsuitable\"\nfor publication at the time it was written.\n\n#  distributed via \u003cnettime\u003e: no commercial use without permission\n#  \u003cnettime\u003e is a moderated mailing list for net criticism,\n#  collaborative text filtering and cultural politics of the nets\n#  more info: majordomo@bbs.thing.net and \"info nettime-l\" in the msg body\n#  archive: http://www.nettime.org contact: nettime@bbs.thing.net\n\n--- end forwarded text\n\n\n-- \n-----------------\nR.

How do I know what your version of \ncreative attire is?  Maybe it\u0027s purely functional.\n\nI was at a loud party recently, sufficiently loud that conversation of any \nkind was extremely difficult, and intoxication was the norm.   I was \nworking on what my algorithm for meeting people there should be and one of \nthe candidates was \"women, in order of attractiveness.\"   I flinched from \nthat, rather violently.

At a \nparty.....well, if you can\u0027t hear the conversation they are having, or if \non the net all you have is a photo.....\n\nYou just can\u0027t tell important things from a picture and a few words.  It\u0027s \nnot how we are built.   There\u0027s no geek code for the heart and soul.\n(And if there were people would lie and game the system.)\nIt\u0027s too easy to say \"Oh, no!

This is all entirely speculative based on nothing \nbut superstitious association unless you actually have time in the \nuser\u0027s company.   Which is why we tend to be screwed when our circle of\nexposure shrinks after school.\n\nPersonally, as a writer, the whole internet meet \u0026 email thing ought to \nwork better for me than it does for other people, but interestingly, it \ndoesn\u0027t.   I have to put out the same amount of effort and reap about the \nsame poor results.

Ayatollah Chirac has decreed a death\nsentence on Houellebecq and liked-minded fundamentalists have offered\nmillions of euros bounty for his head, so he has gone into hiding\nunder police protection for a few years.\n\nOr maybe some handful of Muslims are acting uppity and dragging him to\ncourt under \"hate speech\" laws make a point about people not showin\u0027\ndem da massive respect dat dey deserve, especially these days.\n\nOr maybe some journo is trying to fill column inches on a boring day.\n\n\nBTW I read Houellebecq\u0027s \"Extension du domaine de la lutte\" recently,\nabout a depressed computer services dude working in Paris, looking for\nlove and not finding it, slowing losing his marbles and trying to get\na friend of his to kill a woman, and ending up in a clinic for\nnutcases...  Yikes!  Purposely provocative, very depressing, with some\nunbelievably boring passages where the anti-hero writes little stories\nabout animals talking philosophical mumbo-jumbo to each other, quoted\ninline in full for pages on end.\n\nIt starts out:\n\n\"On Friday evening, I was invited to a party with some colleagues from\nwork.  There were about thrity of us, all professionals aged from\ntwenty-five to forty.  At one point, some cunt started getting\nundressed. She took off her T-shirt, then her bra, then her skirt, all\nthe while making unbelievable faces.  She pranced around for a few\nseconds, then she started getting dresesd again because she didn\u0027t\nknow what else to do.  Anyway she never sleeps with anyone.  Which\nunderlines the absurdity of her behaviour.\n\nAfter my fourth glass of vodka I started to feel pretty bad so I had\nto go lie down on a bunch of cushions behind the couch.  Shortly after\nthat, two girls came and sat on the couch.  Those girls are not pretty\nat all, the two fat office cows actually.  They go to eat together and\nread books about the development of language in children, all that\nsort of stuff.\"\n\n... and it\u0027s downhill from there!\n\n\nR\n\n",

Like Woody Allen said, 90% of life is\nshowing up, right?\n\n\nAlmost anyone can find a church where the sermons don\u0027t make you bust\nout laughing, and you\u0027re set. I, for instance, am a Unitarian, which,\nas someone once observed, is merely a decompression chamber between a\nreal church and a golf course. (ObUUJokes: Mid 70\u0027s bumper-sticker:\n\"Honk if you\u0027re not sure\"; Lenny Bruce: \"Did you hear about how the\nKlan burned a question mark on the Unitarian\u0027s lawn?\"; \"Unitarians\nwould rather go to a discussion group about heaven than to heaven\nitself.\"; \"Unitarians pray \u0027to whom it may concern\u0027\"; etc...)\n\nBut, seriously, folks, my teenage-adopted denomination (I\u0027m, um,\nlapsed, on several fronts, a Dutch-Reformed-turned-atheist father and\nan agnostic mother who used to be a southern Baptist of some stripe\nor another) and frankly limousine liberal secular-humanist\ncongregation is about as orthogonal to my present\ncongenital-Republican small-l libertarian turned anarchocapitalist\npolitics as it is possible to be (except for the secular-humanist\nbit...), and I still go pretty regularly, though not as much as I\nused to. Heck, the older I get the less of the divine I believe in.\nI\u0027m asymptotically approaching my father\u0027s atheism, these days, and I\nshow up at least once a month. Nice folks though, when I can keep a\ncivil tongue in my head -- smart too, when I can\u0027t and end up arguing\nwith them. :-).\n\n\nAnyway, if *I* can end up hitched, anyone can. Talk about orthogonal.\nI met my practically-socialist state-education-bureaucrat wife one\nyear after I started, moved in with her 6 weeks later :-), married\nher 2 years after that, and I wasn\u0027t even trying meet women. I was\njust looking to make friends as I was new in town.\n\n\nThe trick to the church thing is, whatever denomination/congregation\nyou end up in, expect to end up with a mate, not a date. I mean, some\nguys manage to stay single, but most, like me, don\u0027t. You can\npractically see the laser-sights light up when you walk into a\nroom...\n\nThat\u0027s because, of course, most churches are *run* by women. Most\nregular attendants are women. Hell, 65% of all new *ministers*, in\nprotestant denominations, at least, are women. No matter your age,\nlooks, intelligence, whatever, you\u0027ll end up surrounded by women.\nYou\u0027ll be outnumbered, even several to one -- some of whom are at\nleast better looking than you are. :-). The only place where there\nare *more* women running things is in grass-roots Republican politics\n- -- but I won\u0027t go there, I promise.\n\n\nIf I may make a presumption here, since you brought it up, I figure\nthat between the sophistication and diversity of the subcontinent\u0027s\nreligions, and the ubiquity of Indians in various stages of\nassimilation in So/NoCal, you can find some place to hang out near\nyou, Rohit.

So here we Dave\u0027s attempt to fool you into thinking they\u0027re\nsome sort of monsters, violent ones no less.\n\nAnyone who works with Hemenway or Kearney should be aware that these people\nare nothing less than monsters, who will stoop to any level to get their\nway.\n\nYeah sure Dave, whatever you need to believe.\n\nThe truth is these folks do a fine job of actually helping others and\nimproving RSS in general.  Each with their own brand of attitude, to be\nsure, but they seem to be pretty focused on actually helping things move\nforward.  How is that being monstrous?\n\nIs Dave trying to slander their good names and thus poison the public\u0027s\nperception of them?  If you haven\u0027t already, contact them and ask them how\nthey feel about this foolishness.\n\n\n 9/18/02; 10:07:38 AM - Discuss\n\n\n\nDave deflects what he can\u0027t take the time to understand\n\n\nIt\u0027s really quite pitiful.  When normal people don\u0027t understand something\nthey usually try learning about it.  They read up, ask questions and seek\nthe help of those that understand it.  This before shooting their mouths off\nand looking like fools.\n\nWhat Dave does is just the opposite.\n\nPosts a link to something he doesn\u0027t understand\nGet\u0027s a bunch of e-mail from people who do understand it\nDerides the idea as being \u0027too much trouble\u0027 and blogs it.\nExpects others to do research for him\nAbuses anyone who tries to help him\nPontificates, incorrectly, about only part of the issue\nRealizes he\u0027s been a fool but refuses to correct himself\nPlods forward pedantically trying to defend his idiocy\nTries making the educated people look like fools.\nSends private e-mails to them trying to scare them off.\nExposes any private e-mail they write, out of context.\nDeflects and runs off to some new topic, repeats from #1\nHis continued diatribes about RSS-1.0 and it\u0027s use of RDF reveal this to be\ntrue.  Dave doesn\u0027t get the idea of the semantic web.  He\u0027d rather have you\nfollow his stupid ideas than dare admit that the work of others is worth\ntrying.\n\nOne reader wrote to us with a good analogy.  \"It\u0027s like that movie The\nPoseidon Adventure.  Dave\u0027s like the purser ranting and raving that the\npassengers should follow him and march toward the bow.  I don\u0027t know about\nyou but I\u0027d rather be with the fat lady swimming toward the engine room.\nThe ship\u0027s fucking sinking and I don\u0027t want to be following the idiot.\"\n\nDave\u0027s idea of love is fucking everyone else without so much as a reach\naround.  You\u0027re supposed to just shut up and take it.  After all, why would\ngood ol\u0027 Uncle Dave want to hurt you?  It\u0027s all about love, right?  To hell\nwith asking you if you want to get shafted.  And if you dare complain, he\nsavages you.  Then he tries to make everyone think you\u0027re the one causing\nall the trouble.\n\nWe\u0027ve news for you Dave, we\u0027re wise to your tactics and we\u0027re talking\namongst ourselves about it.  We\u0027re routing around you damaging behavoir.\nThat\u0027s where we\u0027re coming from.\n\nIf you have an example of how you\u0027ve tried to help Dave, please drop us an\ne-mail about it.  We\u0027ll keep it strictly confidential of course.  Send it\nalong to zaphod@egroups.com\n\n\n 9/12/02; 10:13:11 AM - Discuss\n\n\n\n\nTrying to talk with Dave is like trying to wrestle a pig...\n\n\nThe trouble is, you get dirty and the pig seems to like it.\n\nAnother developer tries talking to Dave and discovers it\u0027s fundamentally\nimpossible:\n\nHis basic response was just that RDF was a joke and the Semantic Web\ndevelopers are doing a terrible job.\n\nIn the span of less than five minutes Dave makes such an ass of himself that\npeople at other tables start whispering \"that guy is an idiot...\"\n\nThe zaphodim, however, are veteran pig wrestlers.  If you\u0027ve got a similar\ntale from the mud pit, be sure to drop us a line at: zaphod@egroups.com.\n\n\n 9/11/02; 2:17:58 PM - Discuss (1 response)\n\n\n\n\nAha! Some backing down by the whining one?\n\n\nIt would appear the \u0027dictator release\u0027 strategy that Dave\u0027s been trying on\nhis crappy little set of RSS hacks is failing to gain support.\n\nI\u0027m going to push back the caveat-removing on the 2.0 spec by 24 hours.\nStill have work to do on the sample file, I want to look into the RFC for\ntime-date specs, and get started on the Radio implementation of 2.0. I have\nto prepare for Seybold tomorrow, and I want to a little memorial for 9-11. A\nbusy few days for a guy still recovering. Also, it would be great if people\nwho make content tools could review the 2.0 spec and see if there are any\ndeal-stoppers.\n\nHell yeah there are deal stoppers, like nobody wants it nor will they use\nit!\n\nThe poor Radio customers!  The poor Salon blog users!  They\u0027re going to be\ndragged unwillingly into producing XML content that nobody will use!  So\nwith the flip of his mighty upgrade switch Dave is going to turn all their\ncontent into totally unsupported garbage!!!\n\nYa better speak up now folks otherwise your content is going to start\ngetting rejected!\n\nOf course at the same time Dave tries to play the sympathy card.  What utter\nfucking nonsense.  This past weekend, the blogosphere excoriates him for his\n\u0027blame America\u0027 bullshit.  Then the RSS community tells him to get stuffed\nwith his dictator release of RSS.  Now he\u0027s trying to pretend we should be\nnice to him because he\u0027s still recovering?\n\nUh, Dave, if you want to take a rest from the battle then stop picking\nfights.  We\u0027ll still kick your ass regardless.  That\u0027s what years of your\nabusing people has gotten you Dave.  No sympathy anymore, none whatsoever.\n\n\n 9/11/02; 1:56:10 PM - Discuss\n\n\n\n\nDave is Scary on 9/11\n\nPosted on Scripting News on 9/10/2002:\n\n\nNote: During the day tomorrow there will be no updates to Scripting News.\nI\u0027ll be in SF at Seybold, leading a discussion on Web Services for\nPublishing with people from Amazon, Apple, Google and Jake Savin of\nUserLand. I may be able to update my Radio weblog, but only if there\u0027s\nsomething really important to report. So best wishes for a happy and safe\n9-11.\nWhat kind of asshole wishes people a happy 9/11??!?!?!?!??!! Obviously\nsomeone who doesn\u0027t have a clue nor lost anyone in the tragedy.\n\n\n 9/11/02; 7:56:06 AM - Discuss\n\n\n\n\nYeow and we though we were harsh!\n\n\nWow, apparently Dave\u0027s sticking his neck out quite far these days.  Craig\nSchamp practically keel-hauls him with this one.  He wraps it up with:\n\nThe man seems to show over and over that he\u0027s nothing more than a whining\nbuffoon\n\nGive that man an honorary Zaphodim membership card and secret decoder ring!\n\nRelated links over at PhotoDude, Richard Bennett, Andrea Harris, Reid Stott,\nJeff Jarvis, Ipse Dixit, and the Fat Guy.\n\n\n 9/9/02; 12:29:45 PM - Discuss\n\n\n\n\nRSS 2.0: code name \"Hitler\"\n\n\nIf Dave tries to steamroll RSS 2.0 through without formal community\nconsensus, here now we call it the \"Hitler\" release of 2.0.\n\n\"No objections\"?  No, he means \"No objections I choose to hear.\"\n\nDave is simply not listening.  People are objecting all over.\n\n\n\n\n 9/6/02; 9:00:02 AM - Discuss\n\n\n\n\nReferral log funnies\n\n\nEvery now and then we check the referral logs to see what\u0027s pointing back to\nus.  We sincerely apologize to the pool soul that used this search.\n\n\n 9/5/02; 12:15:07 PM - Discuss\n\n\n\n\nLuserland Attempts to Trademark \"RSS\"\n\n\nDave has waxed and waned about intellectual property rights and how any\nBigCo that tries to patent its technology or methods is corrupt or morally\nbankrupt. Scripting News is full of examples.\n\nSo we found it surprising, as did many others, when Luserland software tried\nto patent the term \u0027RSS\u0027 back in 2000. Here\u0027s the patent application:\n\nhttp://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser\u003dserial\u0026entry\u003d78025336\n\nThis was apparently just between the start of the RSS 1.0 development\nefforts, and the publication of the specification. Winer knew about the RSS\n1.0 stuff - indeed, he complained about it bitterly at the time.\n\nCould Dave be any more transparent?!?!??!?!!!!!!!\n\nSince when has Dave been required to follow anything he says he wants others\nto do??? A good quote from before he filed the patent application:\n\nTim O\u0027Reilly says patents are OK, he\u0027s just against stupid patents. In the\nspirit of Touch of Grey, Tim man, patents are lock-in of the worst kind.\nThere\u0027s no way to route around them.\n\n 9/4/02; 6:06:51 AM - Discuss\n\n\n\n\nWhen\u0027s a Permalink not a Permalink?\n\n\nWhen Dave writes an item, then removes it!!!!!!!!!!! The permalink links to\nnothing at that point. So apparently the \"perma-\" part in permalink is\npermanent. For everyone except Dave. Too bad his little attempt at a\ndefinition fails to mention this...!!!!!!!!!\n\n\n 9/2/02; 6:16:03 PM - Discuss\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Users like it as now they have something to do \nin between Web conferences and places to store and author \ndocuments, reschedule meetings, relaunch meetings.  Webex likes \nit as people are signed on all the time.  \n\nGreg\n\n\n\nSeptember 19, 2002\n\n  Tadpole\u0027s Secure Web Software Subsidiary Endeavors Technology Teams With Web\n  Meetings Leader WebEx Communications\n  To Provide Best-of-Breed Solution For Extended Group Collaboration During\n  and Between Online Meetings\n\n  Web meetings raise the quality of team interaction and communications for\n  users of the Web\u0027s secure, P2P collaboration network\n\n  ###\n\n  Tadpole Technology plc, the mobile computing and network infrastructure\n  group, today announces that its web collaboration subsidiary, Endeavors\n  Technology, Inc., has teamed with Web meetings leader, WebEx\n  Communications,Inc. to help professionals make better use of corporate time\n  and resources, and gain competitive advantage. By integrating the advanced\n  communications capabilities of the WebEx platform with Endeavors\u0027 secure P2P\n  collaboration network, Endeavors has created a new method of world-class\n  teamwork and interaction without the hassle of travel.\n\n  With the rapid growth in popularity of Web meetings, the rationale for this\n  world-class relationship stems from the growing need for workgroups around\n  the world to maintain the quality of the team collaboration experience\n  between online meetings. The issue by those preferring not to travel is how\n  to continue to collaborate and share information with team members between\n  meetings rather than depending on intermittent, insecure email and multiple\n  copies of constantly changing documents.\n\n  Inter-meeting collaboration needs an asynchronous medium, independent of\n  time. In asynchronous mode, a team member can access, read and edit\n  information relevant to the meeting group at his/her convenience rather than\n  having to fit into the schedules and timeframes of others. A secured\n  environment available only to members of a meeting or project is also\n  essential.\n\n  Endeavors\u0027 Magi technology converts the Web into a secure platform for\n  sharing information directly from people\u0027s desktops. WebEx meetings can be\n  recorded and reviewed at any time, documents shared in the meeting can be\n  actioned in real-time or at a later date, calendars and project schedules\n  can be updated at any time, and new individuals added to the workgroup at\n  will . all in a secure environment with people working across the globe,\n  inside or outside company firewalls.\n\n  Magi peer collaboration securely delivers significant benefits to Web\n  meeting participants. Not only can they share and access information at\n  will, but they can also know which other participants are online or\n  \"present.\" This enables them to chat and message each other, search across\n  other people\u0027s Magi environment, and work jointly on relevant documents\n  highly productively. With Magi collaboration, in tandem with WebEx\n  conferencing, the savings can be huge in terms of travel costs, phone bills,\n  and, most importantly, timely completion of projects and tasks.\n\n  \"In order to realise the full potential of Web meetings, best-of-breed\n  services are needed to eliminate time and geographical boundaries,\" says\n  Bernard Hulme, Tadpole\u0027s group chief executive. \"The powerful combination\n  of Endeavors\u0027 Magi and WebEx\u0027s communications technologies will assist\n  global work teams to better meet critical business goals and deadlines by\n  maintaining teamwork momentum within and between Web meetings.\"\n\n  \"WebEx is transforming the way businesses use the Web for sales, marketing,\n  training, support and product design,\" says David Farrington, vice president\n  of corporate development at WebEx Communications. \"By integrating the\n  communications capabilities of the WebEx platform with Endeavors\u0027 secure\n  collaboration network, Endeavors has created an offering that provides the\n  best in synchronous and asynchronous communications.\"\n\n  About Magi\n  Magi Enterprise 3.0, an award-winning web collaboration system, transforms\n  today\u0027s Web into a highly secure inter- and intra-enterprise collaboration\n  network of files and web resources. For the first time, enterprises can\n  implement ad-hoc Virtual Private Networks for collaboration very rapidly and\n  affordably without disrupting existing applications, networks or work\n  practices. Magi Enterprise 3.0 does this by effectively transforming\n  unsecured, \"read-only\" Web networks into two-way trusted and transparent\n  collaboration environments, through the use of such features as\n  cross-firewall connections, advanced data extraction, an intuitive graphical\n  interface, and universal name spaces generating \"follow me URLs\" for mobile\n  professionals.\n\n  About Endeavors Technology, Inc.\n  Endeavors Technology, Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of mobile computing\n  and network infrastructure vendor Tadpole Technology plc (LSE-TAD,\n  www.tadpole.com), which has plants and offices in Irvine and Carlsbad\n  (California), and Cambridge, Edinburgh, and Bristol (UK).

Hewlett-Packard Co has a Utility Data Center, designed for\n  broader management. International Business Machines Corp\u0027s project eLiza is working\n  to make computers \"self-healing\" when systems break.\n\n  \"Applications still have to run zeroes and ones on some computing engine but the\n  whole idea behind N1 is you stop thinking about that. You don\u0027t think about what box\n  it is running on,\" Sun Vice President Steve MacKay, head of the N1 program, said in an\n  interview on the sidelines of a Sun user conference. \n\n  Many industry executives see computer power eventually being sold like power or\n  water, as a utility that can be turned on or off, in whatever volume one wants whenever\n  needed. \n  For that to happen computers must be tied together seamlessly, rather than cobbling\n  them together with tenuous links, as most networks do today, experts say. There are\n  still major barriers, though, such as communications standards for machines from\n  different vendors to interoperate closely. \n  Sun promised to deliver a \"virtualization engine\" that would let administrators look at\n  their entire network as a pool by the end of the year. Network administrators today\n  often have no automatic system to report what is in the network. \n\n  \"It\u0027ll tell you what you have and how it is laid out,\" promised MacKay\n  The second stage, beginning in 2003, would allow users to identify a service, such as\n  online banking, and allocate resources for them with a few clicks, Sun said. \n  Finally, in 2004, Sun\u0027s software should allow networks to change uses of resources on\n  the fly in response to changing needs, such as a bank assuring quicker online response\n  time for priority users, the company said.\n\n",

Most of the people that are protesting against taking\nout the Iraqi dictator wouldn\u0027t give a rats ass if a nuke went off in NYC.\nThey simply wouldn\u0027t care so why in the hell should the Americal public\nlisten to them on matters of national security?\n\nSo enlighten me, exactly why shouldn\u0027t Hussein be taken out?

    "message": "\n\u003e A world where some live in comfort and plenty, while half of the human \n\u003e race lives on less than $2 a day, is neither just nor stable.\n\nAbsolutely correct. Perhaps the most fundamental thing to realize about \nlife on Earth today.\n\nThe following is a fascinating document of official Government policy \nthat bears close reading. It is the aspirations of a wonderful nation in \nan imperfect world.\n\n\u003e  The war on terrorism is not a clash of civilizations. It does, \n\u003e however, reveal the clash inside a civilization, a battle for the \n\u003e future of the Muslim world. This is a struggle of ideas and this is an \n\u003e area where America must excel.\n\nI was recently at a lecture about the surprising success of Radio Sawa, \nour new music-and-news channel for 15-30 year old Arabs. It\u0027s #1 in \npractically every market it\u0027s entered, nearing 90% listenership in \nAmman. And it\u0027s even beginning to be trusted for news, well past BBC and \ntaking share from every other government broadcaster.\n\nIt is as hard to imagine America losing a war of ideas in the long-term \nas it is to imagine America making any headway at all in the short term.\n\nMany of you may disagree, but I found the document below surprisingly \ncentrist. If you know the code, you can hear clearly partisan tones, re: \nICC, Taiwan Relations Act, etc. But, still, this is as much a Democratic \nplatform as not. Africa and AIDS take up more mindshare than I feared \nthey might.\n\nAs you read, replace \"United States\" with \"Roman Empire\" and it may make \nas much sense, in the long view of history. I don\u0027t know how proud to be \nabout that, but it is telling. Sometime I daydream that the President \nmight sit down with the nation with Perotista flip charts and explain to \nour citizens the sheer vastness of our 700+ military installations \noverseas and what they do for us. It would be a powerful education on \nhow engaged we are in the world around us.\n\nHeck, I\u0027d love to see a real-time map of Federal expenditures around the \nglobe, a softly glowing necklace of embassies, carriers, arctic research \nstations, hotels, golf courses, warehouses, libraries, clinics and all \nthe rest of the influence a trillion dollars here or there can buy.\n\nOf course, this still doesn\u0027t leave me any more comfortable with the \nreal news in this document: the Bush Doctrine for pre-emptive strikes. \nI\u0027d sooner repeal the Church amendments on covert action than permit \nsuch a principle to be loosed upon the world.\n\nRohit\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\nSeptember 20, 2002\n\nFull Text: Bush\u0027s National Security Strategy\n\nFollowing is the full text of President Bush\u0027s new national security \nstrategy. The document, entitled \"The National Security Strategy of the \nUnited States,\" will soon be transmitted to Congress as a declaration of \nthe Administration\u0027s policy.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nTHE great struggles of the twentieth century between liberty and \ntotalitarianism ended with a decisive victory for the forces of \nfreedom -- and a single sustainable model for national success: freedom, \ndemocracy, and free enterprise. In the twenty-first century, only \nnations that share a commitment to protecting basic human rights and \nguaranteeing political and economic freedom will be able to unleash the \npotential of their people and assure their future prosperity. People \neverywhere want to say what they think; choose who will govern them; \nworship as they please; educate their children -- male and female; own \nproperty; and enjoy the benefits of their labor. These values of freedom \nare right and true for every user, in every society -- and the duty of\nprotecting these values against their enemies is the common calling of \nfreedom-loving people across the globe and across the ages.\n\nToday, the United States enjoys a position of unparalleled military \nstrength and great economic and political influence. In keeping with our \nheritage and principles, we do not use our strength to press for \nunilateral advantage. We seek instead to create a balance of power that \nfavors human freedom: conditions in which all nations and all societies \ncan choose for themselves the rewards and challenges of political and \neconomic liberty. By making the world safer, we allow the people of the \nworld to make their own lives better. We will defend this just peace \nagainst threats from terrorists and tyrants. We will preserve the peace \nby building good relations among the great powers. We will extend the \npeace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent.\n\nDefending our Nation against its enemies is the first and fundamental \ncommitment of the Federal Government. Today, that task has changed \ndramatically. Enemies in the past needed great armies and great \nindustrial capabilities to endanger America. Now, shadowy networks of \nindividuals can bring great chaos and suffering to our shores for less \nthan it costs to purchase a single tank. Terrorists are organized to \npenetrate open societies and to turn the power of modern technologies \nagainst us.\n\nTo defeat this threat we must make use of every tool in our arsenal -- \nfrom better homeland defenses and law enforcement to intelligence and \ncutting off terrorist financing. The war against terrorists of global \nreach is a global enterprise of uncertain duration. America will help \nnations that need our assistance in combating terror. And America will \nhold to account nations that are compromised by terror -- because the \nallies of terror are the enemies of civilization. The United States and \ncountries cooperating with us must not allow the terrorists to develop \nnew home bases. Together, we will seek to deny them sanctuary at every \nturn.\n\nThe gravest danger our Nation faces lies at the crossroads of radicalism \nand technology. Our enemies have openly declared that they are seeking \nweapons of mass destruction, and evidence indicates that they are doing \nso with determination. The United States will not allow these efforts to \nsucceed. We will build defenses against ballistic missiles and other \nmeans of delivery. We will cooperate with other nations to deny, \ncontain, and curtail our enemies\u0027 efforts to acquire dangerous \ntechnologies. And, as a matter of common sense and self-defense, America \nwill act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed. We \ncannot defend America and our friends by hoping for the best. So we must \nbe prepared to defeat our enemies\u0027 plans, using the best intelligence \nand proceeding with deliberation. History will judge harshly those who \nsaw this coming danger but failed to act. In the new world we have \nentered, the only path to safety is the path of action.\n\nAs we defend the peace, we will also take advantage of an historic \nopportunity to preserve the peace. Today, the international community \nhas the best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the \nseventeenth century to build a world where great powers compete in peace \ninstead of continually prepare for war. Today, the world\u0027s great powers \nfind ourselves on the same side -- united by common dangers of terrorist \nviolence and chaos. The United States will build on these common \ninterests to promote global security. We are also increasingly united by \ncommon values. Russia is in the midst of a hopeful transition, reaching \nfor its democratic future and a partner in the war on terror. Chinese \nleaders are discovering that economic freedom is the only source of \nnational wealth. In time, they will find that social and political \nfreedom is the only source of national greatness. America will encourage \nthe advancement of democracy and economic openness in both nations, \nbecause these are the best foundations for domestic stability and \ninternational order. We will strongly resist aggression from other great \npowers -- even as we welcome their peaceful pursuit of prosperity, \ntrade, and cultural advancement.\n\nFinally, the United States will use this moment of opportunity to extend \nthe benefits of freedom across the globe. We will actively work to bring \nthe hope of democracy, development, free markets, and free trade to \nevery corner of the world. The events of September 11, 2001, taught us \nthat weak states, like Afghanistan, can pose as great a danger to our \nnational interests as strong states. Poverty does not make poor people \ninto terrorists and murderers. Yet poverty, weak institutions, and \ncorruption can make weak states vulnerable to terrorist networks and \ndrug cartels within their borders.\n\nThe United States will stand beside any nation determined to build a \nbetter future by seeking the rewards of liberty for its people. Free \ntrade and free markets have proven their ability to lift whole societies \nout of poverty -- so the United States will work with individual \nnations, entire regions, and the entire global trading community to \nbuild a world that trades in freedom and therefore grows in prosperity. \nThe United States will deliver greater development assistance through \nthe New Millennium Challenge Account to nations that govern justly, \ninvest in their people, and encourage economic freedom. We will also \ncontinue to lead the world in efforts to reduce the terrible toll of \nAIDS and other infectious diseases.\n\nIn building a balance of power that favors freedom, the United States is \nguided by the conviction that all nations have important \nresponsibilities. Nations that enjoy freedom must actively fight terror. \nNations that depend on international stability must help prevent the \nspread of weapons of mass destruction. Nations that seek international \naid must govern themselves wisely, so that aid is well spent. For \nfreedom to thrive, accountability must be expected and required.\n\nWe are also guided by the conviction that no nation can build a safer, \nbetter world alone. Alliances and multilateral institutions can multiply \nthe strength of freedom-loving nations. The United States is committed \nto lasting institutions like the United Nations, the World Trade \nOrganization, the Organization of American States, and NATO as well as \nother long-standing alliances. Coalitions of the willing can augment \nthese permanent institutions. In all cases, international obligations \nare to be taken seriously. They are not to be undertaken symbolically to \nrally support for an ideal without furthering its attainment.\n\nFreedom is the non-negotiable demand of human dignity; the birthright of \nevery user -- in every civilization. Throughout history, freedom has\nbeen threatened by war and terror; it has been challenged by the \nclashing wills of powerful states and the evil designs of tyrants; and \nit has been tested by widespread poverty and disease. Today, humanity \nholds in its hands the opportunity to further freedom\u0027s triumph over all \nthese foes. The United States welcomes our responsibility to lead in \nthis great mission.\n\nI. Overview of America\u0027s International Strategy\n\n\n\"Our Nation\u0027s cause has always been larger than our Nation\u0027s defense. We \nfight, as we always fight, for a just peace -- a peace that favors \nliberty. We will defend the peace against the threats from terrorists \nand tyrants. We will preserve the peace by building good relations among \nthe great powers. And we will extend the peace by encouraging free and \nopen societies on every continent.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Bush\nWest Point, New York\nJune 1, 2002\n\n\n\nThe United States possesses unprecedented -- and unequaled -- strength \nand influence in the world. Sustained by faith in the principles of \nliberty, and the value of a free society, this position comes with \nunparalleled responsibilities, obligations, and opportunity. The great \nstrength of this nation must be used to promote a balance of power that \nfavors freedom.\n\nFor most of the twentieth century, the world was divided by a great \nstruggle over ideas: destructive totalitarian visions versus freedom and \nequality.\n\nThat great struggle is over. The militant visions of class, nation, and \nrace which promised utopia and delivered misery have been defeated and \ndiscredited. America is now threatened less by conquering states than we \nare by failing ones. We are menaced less by fleets and armies than by \ncatastrophic technologies in the hands of the embittered few. We must \ndefeat these threats to our Nation, allies, and friends.\n\nThis is also a time of opportunity for America. We will work to \ntranslate this moment of influence into decades of peace, prosperity, \nand liberty. The U.S. national security strategy will be based on a \ndistinctly American internationalism that reflects the union of our \nvalues and our national interests. The aim of this strategy is to help \nmake the world not just safer but better. Our goals on the path to \nprogress are clear: political and economic freedom, peaceful relations \nwith other states, and respect for human dignity.\n\nAnd this path is not America\u0027s alone. It is open to all.\n\nTo achieve these goals, the United States will:\n\n*\tchampion aspirations for human dignity;\n\n*\tstrengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent \nattacks against us and our friends;\n\n*\twork with others to defuse regional conflicts;\n\n*\tprevent our enemies from threatening us, our allies, and our \nfriends, with weapons of mass destruction;\n\n*\tignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and \nfree trade;\n\n*\texpand the circle of development by opening societies and building \nthe infrastructure of democracy;\n\n*\tdevelop agendas for cooperative action with other main centers of \nglobal power; and\n\n*\ttransform America\u0027s national security institutions to meet the \nchallenges and opportunities of the twenty-first century.\n\n\nII. Champion Aspirations for Human Dignity\n\n\n\"Some worry that it is somehow undiplomatic or impolite to speak the \nlanguage of right and wrong. I disagree. Different circumstances require \ndifferent methods, but not different moralities.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Bush\nWest Point, New York\nJune 1, 2002\n\n\n\nIn pursuit of our goals, our first imperative is to clarify what we \nstand for: the United States must defend liberty and justice because \nthese principles are right and true for all people everywhere. No nation \nowns these aspirations, and no nation is exempt from them. Fathers and \nmothers in all societies want their children to be educated and to live \nfree from poverty and violence. No people on earth yearn to be \noppressed, aspire to servitude, or eagerly await the midnight knock of \nthe secret police.\n\nAmerica must stand firmly for the nonnegotiable demands of human \ndignity: the rule of law; limits on the absolute power of the state; \nfree speech; freedom of worship; equal justice; respect for women; \nreligious and ethnic tolerance; and respect for private property.\n\nThese demands can be met in many ways. America\u0027s constitution has served \nus well. Many other nations, with different histories and cultures, \nfacing different circumstances, have successfully incorporated these \ncore principles into their own systems of governance. History has not \nbeen kind to those nations which ignored or flouted the rights and \naspirations of their people.\n\nOur own history is a long struggle to live up to our ideals. But even in \nour worst moments, the principles enshrined in the Declaration of \nIndependence were there to guide us. As a result, America is not just a \nstronger, but is a freer and more just society.\n\nToday, these ideals are a lifeline to lonely defenders of liberty. And \nwhen openings arrive, we can encourage change -- as we did in central \nand eastern Europe between 1989 and 1991, or in Belgrade in 2000. When \nwe see democratic processes take hold among our friends in Taiwan or in \nthe Republic of Korea, and see elected leaders replace generals in Latin \nAmerica and Africa, we see examples of how authoritarian systems can \nevolve, marrying local history and traditions with the principles we all \ncherish.\n\nEmbodying lessons from our past and using the opportunity we have today, \nthe national security strategy of the United States must start from \nthese core beliefs and look outward for possibilities to expand liberty.\n\nOur principles will guide our government\u0027s decisions about international \ncooperation, the character of our foreign assistance, and the allocation \nof resources. They will guide our actions and our words in international \nbodies.\n\nWe will:\n\n*\tspeak out honestly about violations of the nonnegotiable demands of \nhuman dignity using our voice and vote in international institutions to \nadvance freedom;\n\n*\tuse our foreign aid to promote freedom and support those who \nstruggle non-violently for it, ensuring that nations moving toward \ndemocracy are rewarded for the steps they take;\n\n*\tmake freedom and the development of democratic institutions key \nthemes in our bilateral relations, seeking solidarity and cooperation \nfrom other democracies while we press governments that deny human rights \nto move toward a better future; and\n\n*\ttake special efforts to promote freedom of religion and conscience \nand defend it from encroachment by repressive governments.\n\n\nWe will champion the cause of human dignity and oppose those who resist \nit.\n\nIII. Strengthen Alliances to Defeat Global Terrorism and Work to Prevent \nAttacks Against Us and Our Friends\n\n\n\"Just three days removed from these events, Americans do not yet have \nthe distance of history. But our responsibility to history is already \nclear: to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil. War has been \nwaged against us by stealth and deceit and murder. This nation is \npeaceful, but fierce when stirred to anger. The conflict was begun on \nthe timing and terms of others. It will end in a way, and at an hour, of \nour choosing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Bush\nWashington, D.C. (The National Cathedral)\nSeptember 14, 2001\n\n\n\nThe United States of America is fighting a war against terrorists of \nglobal reach. The enemy is not a single political regime or user or\nreligion or ideology. The enemy is terrorism -- premeditated, \npolitically motivated violence perpetrated against innocents.\n\nIn many regions, legitimate grievances prevent the emergence of a \nlasting peace. Such grievances deserve to be, and must be, addressed \nwithin a political process. But no cause justifies terror. The United \nStates will make no concessions to terrorist demands and strike no deals \nwith them. We make no distinction between terrorists and those who \nknowingly harbor or provide aid to them.\n\nThe struggle against global terrorism is different from any other war in \nour history. It will be fought on many fronts against a particularly \nelusive enemy over an extended period of time. Progress will come \nthrough the persistent accumulation of successes -- some seen, some \nunseen.\n\nToday our enemies have seen the results of what civilized nations can, \nand will, do against regimes that harbor, support, and use terrorism to \nachieve their political goals. Afghanistan has been liberated; coalition \nforces continue to hunt down the Taliban and al-Qaida. But it is not \nonly this battlefield on which we will engage terrorists. Thousands of \ntrained terrorists remain at large with cells in North America, South \nAmerica, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and across Asia.\n\nOur priority will be first to disrupt and destroy terrorist \norganizations of global reach and attack their leadership; command, \ncontrol, and communications; material support; and finances. This will \nhave a disabling effect upon the terrorists\u0027 ability to plan and operate.\n\nWe will continue to encourage our regional partners to take up a \ncoordinated effort that isolates the terrorists. Once the regional \ncampaign localizes the threat to a particular state, we will help ensure \nthe state has the military, law enforcement, political, and financial \ntools necessary to finish the task.\n\nThe United States will continue to work with our allies to disrupt the \nfinancing of terrorism. We will identify and block the sources of \nfunding for terrorism, freeze the assets of terrorists and those who \nsupport them, deny terrorists access to the international financial \nsystem, protect legitimate charities from being abused by terrorists, \nand prevent the movement of terrorists\u0027 assets through alternative \nfinancial networks.\n\nHowever, this campaign need not be sequential to be effective, the \ncumulative effect across all regions will help achieve the results we \nseek.\n\nWe will disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations by:\n\n*\tdirect and continuous action using all the elements of national and \ninternational power. Our immediate focus will be those terrorist \norganizations of global reach and any terrorist or state sponsor of \nterrorism which attempts to gain or use weapons of mass destruction \n(WMD) or their precursors;\n\n*\tdefending the United States, the American people, and our interests \nat home and abroad by identifying and destroying the threat before it \nreaches our borders. While the United States will constantly strive to \nenlist the support of the international community, we will not hesitate \nto act alone, if necessary, to exercise our right of self-defense by \nacting preemptively against such terrorists, to prevent them from doing \nharm against our people and our country; and\n\n*\tdenying further sponsorship, support, and sanctuary to terrorists \nby convincing or compelling states to accept their sovereign \nresponsibilities.\n\n\nWe will also wage a war of ideas to win the battle against international \nterrorism. This includes:\n\n*\tusing the full influence of the United States, and working closely \nwith allies and friends, to make clear that all acts of terrorism are \nillegitimate so that terrorism will be viewed in the same light as \nslavery, piracy, or genocide: behavior that no respectable government \ncan condone or support and all must oppose;\n\n*\tsupporting moderate and modern government, especially in the Muslim \nworld, to ensure that the conditions and ideologies that promote \nterrorism do not find fertile ground in any nation;\n\n*\tdiminishing the underlying conditions that spawn terrorism by \nenlisting the international community to focus its efforts and resources \non areas most at risk; and\n\n*\tusing effective public diplomacy to promote the free flow of \ninformation and ideas to kindle the hopes and aspirations of freedom of \nthose in societies ruled by the sponsors of global terrorism.\n\n\nWhile we recognize that our best defense is a good offense we are also \nstrengthening America\u0027s homeland security to protect against and deter \nattack.\n\nThis Administration has proposed the largest government reorganization \nsince the Truman Administration created the National Security Council \nand the Department of Defense. Centered on a new Department of Homeland \nSecurity and including a new unified military command and a fundamental \nreordering of the FBI, our comprehensive plan to secure the homeland \nencompasses every level of government and the cooperation of the public \nand the private sector.\n\nThis strategy will turn adversity into opportunity. For example, \nemergency management systems will be better able to cope not just with \nterrorism but with all hazards. Our medical system will be strengthened \nto manage not just bioterror, but all infectious diseases and \nmass-casualty dangers. Our border controls will not just stop \nterrorists, but improve the efficient movement of legitimate traffic.\n\nWhile our focus is protecting America, we know that to defeat terrorism \nin today\u0027s globalized world we need support from our allies and friends. \nWherever possible, the United States will rely on regional organizations \nand state powers to meet their obligations to fight terrorism. Where \ngovernments find the fight against terrorism beyond their capacities, we \nwill match their willpower and their resources with whatever help we and \nour allies can provide.\n\nAs we pursue the terrorists in Afghanistan, we will continue to work \nwith international organizations such as the United Nations, as well as \nnon-governmental organizations, and other countries to provide the \nhumanitarian, political, economic, and security assistance necessary to \nrebuild Afghanistan so that it will never again abuse its people, \nthreaten its neighbors, and provide a haven for terrorists\n\nIn the war against global terrorism, we will never forget that we are \nultimately fighting for our democratic values and way of life. Freedom \nand fear are at war, and there will be no quick or easy end to this \nconflict. In leading the campaign against terrorism, we are forging new, \nproductive international relationships and redefining existing ones in \nways that meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.\n\nIV. Work with Others To Defuse Regional Conflicts\n\n\n\"We build a world of justice, or we will live in a world of coercion. \nThe magnitude of our shared responsibilities makes our disagreements \nlook so small.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Bush\nBerlin, Germany\nMay 23, 2002\n\n\n\nConcerned nations must remain actively engaged in critical regional \ndisputes to avoid explosive escalation and minimize human suffering. In \nan increasingly interconnected world, regional crisis can strain our \nalliances, rekindle rivalries among the major powers, and create \nhorrifying affronts to human dignity. When violence erupts and states \nfalter, the United States will work with friends and partners to \nalleviate suffering and restore stability.\n\nNo doctrine can anticipate every circumstance in which U.S. action -- \ndirect or indirect -- is warranted. We have finite political, economic, \nand military resources to meet our global priorities. The United States \nwill approach each case with these strategic principles in mind:\n\n*\tThe United States should invest time and resources into building \ninternational relationships and institutions that can help manage local \ncrises when they emerge.\n\n*\tThe United States should be realistic about its ability to help \nthose who are unwilling or unready to help themselves. Where and when \npeople are ready to do their part, we will be willing to move decisively.\n\n\nPolicies in several key regions offer some illustrations of how we will \napply these principles:\n\nThe Israeli-Palestinian conflict is critical because of the toll of \nhuman suffering, because of America\u0027s close relationship with the state \nof Israel and key Arab states, and because of that region\u0027s importance \nto other global priorities of the United States. There can be no peace \nfor either side without freedom for both sides. America stands committed \nto an independent and democratic Palestine, living beside Israel in \npeace and security. Like all other people, Palestinians deserve a \ngovernment that serves their interests, and listens to their voices, and \ncounts their votes. The United States will continue to encourage all \nparties to step up to their responsibilities as we seek a just and \ncomprehensive settlement to the conflict.\n\nThe United States, the international donor community, and the World Bank \nstand ready to work with a reformed Palestinian government on economic \ndevelopment, increased humanitarian assistance and a program to \nestablish, finance, and monitor a truly independent judiciary. If \nPalestinians embrace democracy, and the rule of law, confront \ncorruption, and firmly reject terror, they can count on American support \nfor the creation of a Palestinian state.\n\nIsrael also has a large stake in the success of a democratic Palestine. \nPermanent occupation threatens Israel\u0027s identity and democracy. So the \nUnited States continues to challenge Israeli leaders to take concrete \nsteps to support the emergence of a viable, credible Palestinian state. \nAs there is progress towards security, Israel forces need to withdraw \nfully to positions they held prior to September 28, 2000. And consistent \nwith the recommendations of the Mitchell Committee, Israeli settlement \nactivity in the occupied territories must stop. As violence subsides, \nfreedom of movement should be restored, permitting innocent Palestinians \nto resume work and normal life. The United States can play a crucial \nrole but, ultimately, lasting peace can only come when Israelis and \nPalestinians resolve the issues and end the conflict between them.\n\nIn South Asia, the United States has also emphasized the need for India \nand Pakistan to resolve their disputes. This administration invested \ntime and resources building strong bilateral relations with India and \nPakistan. These strong relations then gave us leverage to play a \nconstructive role when tensions in the region became acute. With \nPakistan, our bilateral relations have been bolstered by Pakistan\u0027s \nchoice to join the war against terror and move toward building a more \nopen and tolerant society. The Administration sees India\u0027s potential to \nbecome one of the great democratic powers of the twenty-first century \nand has worked hard to transform our relationship accordingly. Our \ninvolvement in this regional dispute, building on earlier investments in \nbilateral relations, looks first to concrete steps by India and Pakistan \nthat can help defuse military confrontation.\n\nIndonesia took courageous steps to create a working democracy and \nrespect for the rule of law. By tolerating ethnic minorities, respecting \nthe rule of law, and accepting open markets, Indonesia may be able to \nemploy the engine of opportunity that has helped lift some of its \nneighbors out of poverty and desperation. It is the initiative by \nIndonesia that allows U.S. assistance to make a difference.\n\nIn the Western Hemisphere we have formed flexible coalitions with \ncountries that share our priorities, particularly Mexico, Brazil, \nCanada, Chile, and Colombia. Together we will promote a truly democratic \nhemisphere where our integration advances security, prosperity, \nopportunity, and hope. We will work with regional institutions, such as \nthe Summit of the Americas process, the Organization of American States \n(OAS), and the Defense Ministerial of the Americas for the benefit of \nthe entire hemisphere.\n\nParts of Latin America confront regional conflict, especially arising \nfrom the violence of drug cartels and their accomplices. This conflict \nand unrestrained narcotics trafficking could imperil the health and \nsecurity of the United States. Therefore we have developed an active \nstrategy to help the Andean nations adjust their economies, enforce \ntheir laws, defeat terrorist organizations, and cut off the supply of \ndrugs, while -- as important -- we work to reduce the demand for drugs \nin our own country.\n\nIn Colombia, we recognize the link between terrorist and extremist \ngroups that challenge the security of the state and drug trafficking \nactivities that help finance the operations of such groups. We are \nworking to help Colombia defend its democratic institutions and defeat \nillegal armed groups of both the left and right by extending effective \nsovereignty over the entire national territory and provide basic \nsecurity to the Colombian people.\n\nIn Africa, promise and opportunity sit side by side with disease, war, \nand desperate poverty. This threatens both a core value of the United \nStates -- preserving human dignity -- and our strategic priority -- \ncombating global terror. American interests and American principles, \ntherefore, lead in the same direction: we will work with others for an \nAfrican continent that lives in liberty, peace, and growing prosperity. \nTogether with our European allies, we must help strengthen Africa\u0027s \nfragile states, help build indigenous capability to secure porous \nborders, and help build up the law enforcement and intelligence \ninfrastructure to deny havens for terrorists.\n\nAn ever more lethal environment exists in Africa as local civil wars \nspread beyond borders to create regional war zones. Forming coalitions \nof the willing and cooperative security arrangements are key to \nconfronting these emerging transnational threats.\n\nAfrica\u0027s great size and diversity requires a security strategy that \nfocuses bilateral engagement, and builds coalitions of the willing. This \nadministration will focus on three interlocking strategies for the \nregion:\n\n*\tcountries with major impact on their neighborhood such as South \nAfrica, Nigeria, Kenya, and Ethiopia are anchors for regional engagement \nand require focused attention;\n\n*\tcoordination with European allies and international institutions is \nessential for constructive conflict mediation and successful peace \noperations; and\n\n*\tAfrica\u0027s capable reforming states and sub-regional organizations \nmust be strengthened as the primary means to address transnational \nthreats on a sustained basis.\n\n\nUltimately the path of political and economic freedom presents the \nsurest route to progress in sub-Saharan Africa, where most wars are \nconflicts over material resources and political access often tragically \nwaged on the basis of ethnic and religious difference. The transition to \nthe African Union with its stated commitment to good governance and a \ncommon responsibility for democratic political systems offers \nopportunities to strengthen democracy on the continent.\n\nV. Prevent Our Enemies from Threatening Us, Our Allies, and Our Friends \nwith Weapons of Mass Destruction\n\n\n\"The gravest danger to freedom lies at the crossroads of radicalism and \ntechnology. When the spread of chemical and biological and nuclear \nweapons, along with ballistic missile technology -- when that occurs, \neven weak states and small groups could attain a catastrophic power to \nstrike great nations. Our enemies have declared this very intention, and \nhave been caught seeking these terrible weapons. They want the \ncapability to blackmail us, or to harm us, or to harm our friends -- and \nwe will oppose them with all our power.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Bush\nWest Point, New York\nJune 1, 2002\n\n\n\nThe nature of the Cold War threat required the United States -- with our \nallies and friends -- to emphasize deterrence of the enemy\u0027s use of \nforce, producing a grim strategy of mutual assured destruction. With the \ncollapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, our security \nenvironment has undergone profound transformation.\n\nHaving moved from confrontation to cooperation as the hallmark of our \nrelationship with Russia, the dividends are evident: an end to the \nbalance of terror that divided us; an historic reduction in the nuclear \narsenals on both sides; and cooperation in areas such as \ncounterterrorism and missile defense that until recently were \ninconceivable.\n\nBut new deadly challenges have emerged from rogue states and terrorists. \nNone of these contemporary threats rival the sheer destructive power \nthat was arrayed against us by the Soviet Union. However, the nature and \nmotivations of these new adversaries, their determination to obtain \ndestructive powers hitherto available only to the world\u0027s strongest \nstates, and the greater likelihood that they will use weapons of mass \ndestruction against us, make today\u0027s security environment more complex \nand dangerous.\n\nIn the 1990s we witnessed the emergence of a small number of rogue \nstates that, while different in important ways, share a number of \nattributes. These states:\n\n*\tbrutalize their own people and squander their national resources \nfor the personal gain of the rulers;\n\n*\tdisplay no regard for international law, threaten their neighbors, \nand callously violate international treaties to which they are party;\n\n*\tare determined to acquire weapons of mass destruction, along with \nother advanced military technology, to be used as threats or offensively \nto achieve the aggressive designs of these regimes;\n\n*\tsponsor terrorism around the globe; and\n\n*\treject basic human values and hate the United States and everything \nfor which it stands.\n\n\nAt the time of the Gulf War, we acquired irrefutable proof that Iraq\u0027s \ndesigns were not limited to the chemical weapons it had used against \nIran and its own people, but also extended to the acquisition of nuclear \nweapons and biological agents. In the past decade North Korea has become \nthe world\u0027s principal purveyor of ballistic missiles, and has tested \nincreasingly capable missiles while developing its own WMD arsenal. \nOther rogue regimes seek nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons as \nwell. These states\u0027 pursuit of, and global trade in, such weapons has \nbecome a looming threat to all nations.\n\nWe must be prepared to stop rogue states and their terrorist clients \nbefore they are able to threaten or use weapons of mass destruction \nagainst the United States and our allies and friends. Our response must \ntake full advantage of strengthened alliances, the establishment of new \npartnerships with former adversaries, innovation in the use of military \nforces, modern technologies, including the development of an effective \nmissile defense system, and increased emphasis on intelligence \ncollection and analysis.\n\nOur comprehensive strategy to combat WMD includes:\n\n*\tProactive counterproliferation efforts. We must deter and defend \nagainst the threat before it is unleashed. We must ensure that key \ncapabilities -- detection, active and passive defenses, and counterforce \ncapabilities -- are integrated into our defense transformation and our \nhomeland security systems. Counterproliferation must also be integrated \ninto the doctrine, training, and equipping of our forces and those of \nour allies to ensure that we can prevail in any conflict with WMD-armed \nadversaries.\n\n*\tStrengthened nonproliferation efforts to prevent rogue states and \nterrorists from acquiring the materials, technologies and expertise \nnecessary for weapons of mass destruction. We will enhance diplomacy, \narms control, multilateral export controls, and threat reduction \nassistance that impede states and terrorists seeking WMD, and when \nnecessary, interdict enabling technologies and materials. We will \ncontinue to build coalitions to support these efforts, encouraging their \nincreased political and financial support for nonproliferation and \nthreat reduction programs. The recent G-8 agreement to commit up to $20 \nbillion to a global partnership against proliferation marks a major step \nforward.\n\n*\tEffective consequence management to respond to the effects of WMD \nuse, whether by terrorists or hostile states. Minimizing the effects of \nWMD use against our people will help deter those who possess such \nweapons and dissuade those who seek to acquire them by persuading \nenemies that they cannot attain their desired ends. The United States \nmust also be prepared to respond to the effects of WMD use against our \nforces abroad, and to help friends and allies if they are attacked.\n\n\nIt has taken almost a decade for us to comprehend the true nature of \nthis new threat. Given the goals of rogue states and terrorists, the \nUnited States can no longer solely rely on a reactive posture as we have \nin the past. The inability to deter a potential attacker, the immediacy \nof today\u0027s threats, and the magnitude of potential harm that could be \ncaused by our adversaries\u0027 choice of weapons, do not permit that option. \nWe cannot let our enemies strike first.\n\n*\tIn the Cold War, especially following the Cuban missile crisis, we \nfaced a generally status quo, risk-averse adversary. Deterrence was an \neffective defense. But deterrence based only upon the threat of \nretaliation is far less likely to work against leaders of rogue states \nmore willing to take risks, gambling with the lives of their people, and \nthe wealth of their nations.\n\n*\tIn the Cold War, weapons of mass destruction were considered \nweapons of last resort whose use risked the destruction of those who \nused them. Today, our enemies see weapons of mass destruction as weapons \nof choice. For rogue states these weapons are tools of intimidation and \nmilitary aggression against their neighbors. These weapons may also \nallow these states to attempt to blackmail the United States and our \nallies to prevent us from deterring or repelling the aggressive behavior \nof rogue states. Such states also see these weapons as their best means \nof overcoming the conventional superiority of the United States.\n\n*\tTraditional concepts of deterrence will not work against a \nterrorist enemy whose avowed tactics are wanton destruction and the \ntargeting of innocents; whose so-called soldiers seek martyrdom in death \nand whose most potent protection is statelessness. The overlap between \nstates that sponsor terror and those that pursue WMD compels us to \naction.\n\n\nFor centuries, international law recognized that nations need not suffer \nan attack before they can lawfully take action to defend themselves \nagainst forces that present an imminent danger of attack. Legal scholars \nand international jurists often conditioned the legitimacy of preemption \non the existence of an imminent threat -- most often a visible \nmobilization of armies, navies, and air forces preparing to attack.\n\nWe must adapt the concept of imminent threat to the capabilities and \nobjectives of today\u0027s adversaries. Rogue states and terrorists do not \nseek to attack us using conventional means. They know such attacks would \nfail. Instead, they rely on acts of terrorism and, potentially, the use \nof weapons of mass destruction -- weapons that can be easily concealed \nand delivered covertly and without warning.\n\nThe targets of these attacks are our military forces and our civilian \npopulation, in direct violation of one of the principal norms of the law \nof warfare. As was demonstrated by the losses on September 11, 2001, \nmass civilian casualties is the specific objective of terrorists and \nthese losses would be exponentially more severe if terrorists acquired \nand used weapons of mass destruction.\n\nThe United States has long maintained the option of preemptive actions \nto counter a sufficient threat to our national security. The greater the \nthreat, the greater is the risk of inaction -- and the more compelling \nthe case for taking anticipatory action to defend ourselves, even if \nuncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemy\u0027s attack. To \nforestall or prevent such hostile acts by our adversaries, the United \nStates will, if necessary, act preemptively.\n\nThe United States will not use force in all cases to preempt emerging \nthreats, nor should nations use preemption as a pretext for aggression. \nYet in an age where the enemies of civilization openly and actively seek \nthe world\u0027s most destructive technologies, the United States cannot \nremain idle while dangers gather.\n\nWe will always proceed deliberately, weighing the consequences of our \nactions. To support preemptive options, we will:\n\n*\tbuild better, more integrated intelligence capabilities to provide \ntimely, accurate information on threats, wherever they may emerge;\n\n*\tcoordinate closely with allies to form a common assessment of the \nmost dangerous threats; and\n\n*\tcontinue to transform our military forces to ensure our ability to \nconduct rapid and precise operations to achieve decisive results.\n\n\nThe purpose of our actions will always be to eliminate a specific threat \nto the United States or our allies and friends. The reasons for our \nactions will be clear, the force measured, and the cause just.\n\nVI. Ignite a New Era of Global Economic Growth through Free Markets and \nFree Trade.\n\n\n\"When nations close their markets and opportunity is hoarded by a \nprivileged few, no amount -- no amount -- of development aid is ever \nenough. When nations respect their people, open markets, invest in \nbetter health and education, every dollar of aid, every dollar of trade \nrevenue and domestic capital is used more effectively.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Bush\nMonterrey, Mexico\nMarch 22, 2002\n\n\n\nA strong world economy enhances our national security by advancing \nprosperity and freedom in the rest of the world. Economic growth \nsupported by free trade and free markets creates new jobs and higher \nincomes. It allows people to lift their lives out of poverty, spurs \neconomic and legal reform, and the fight against corruption, and it \nreinforces the habits of liberty.\n\nWe will promote economic growth and economic freedom beyond America\u0027s \nshores. All governments are responsible for creating their own economic \npolicies and responding to their own economic challenge. We will use our \neconomic engagement with other countries to underscore the benefits of \npolicies that generate higher productivity and sustained economic \ngrowth, including:\n\n*\tpro-growth legal and regulatory policies to encourage business \ninvestment, innovation, and entrepreneurial activity;\n\n*\ttax policies -- particularly lower marginal tax rates -- that \nimprove incentives for work and investment;\n\n*\trule of law and intolerance of corruption so that people are \nconfident that they will be able to enjoy the fruits of their economic \nendeavors;\n\n*\tstrong financial systems that allow capital to be put to its most \nefficient use;\n\n*\tsound fiscal policies to support business activity;\n\n*\tinvestments in health and education that improve the well-being and \nskills of the labor force and population as a whole; and\n\n*\tfree trade that provides new avenues for growth and fosters the \ndiffusion of technologies and ideas that increase productivity and \nopportunity.\n\n\nThe lessons of history are clear: market economies, not \ncommand-and-control economies with the heavy hand of government, are the \nbest way to promote prosperity and reduce poverty. Policies that further \nstrengthen market incentives and market institutions are relevant for \nall economies -- industrialized countries, emerging markets, and the \ndeveloping world.\n\nA return to strong economic growth in Europe and Japan is vital to U.S. \nnational security interests. We want our allies to have strong economies \nfor their own sake, for the sake of the global economy, and for the sake \nof global security. European efforts to remove structural barriers in \ntheir economies are particularly important in this regard, as are \nJapan\u0027s efforts to end deflation and address the problems of \nnon-performing loans in the Japanese banking system. We will continue to \nuse our regular consultations with Japan and our European partners -- \nincluding through the Group of Seven (G-7) -- to discuss policies they \nare adopting to promote growth in their economies and support higher \nglobal economic growth.\n\nImproving stability in emerging markets is also key to global economic \ngrowth. International flows of investment capital are needed to expand \nthe productive potential of these economies. These flows allow emerging \nmarkets and developing countries to make the investments that raise \nliving standards and reduce poverty. Our long-term objective should be a \nworld in which all countries have investment-grade credit ratings that \nallow them access to international capital markets and to invest in \ntheir future.\n\nWe are committed to policies that will help emerging markets achieve \naccess to larger capital flows at lower cost. To this end, we will \ncontinue to pursue reforms aimed at reducing uncertainty in financial \nmarkets. We will work actively with other countries, the International \nMonetary Fund (IMF), and the private sector to implement the G-7 Action \nPlan negotiated earlier this year for preventing financial crises and \nmore effectively resolving them when they occur.\n\nThe best way to deal with financial crises is to prevent them from \noccurring, and we have encouraged the IMF to improve its efforts doing \nso. We will continue to work with the IMF to streamline the policy \nconditions for its lending and to focus its lending strategy on \nachieving economic growth through sound fiscal and monetary policy, \nexchange rate policy, and financial sector policy.\n\nThe concept of \"free trade\" arose as a moral principle even before it \nbecame a pillar of economics. If you can make something that others \nvalue, you should be able to sell it to them. If others make something \nthat you value, you should be able to buy it. This is real freedom, the \nfreedom for a user -- or a nation -- to make a living. To promote free\ntrade, the Unites States has developed a comprehensive strategy:\n\n*\tSeize the global initiative. The new global trade negotiations we \nhelped launch at Doha in November 2001 will have an ambitious agenda, \nespecially in agriculture, manufacturing, and services, targeted for \ncompletion in 2005. The United States has led the way in completing the \naccession of China and a democratic Taiwan to the World Trade \nOrganization. We will assist Russia\u0027s preparations to join the WTO.\n\n*\tPress regional initiatives. The United States and other democracies \nin the Western Hemisphere have agreed to create the Free Trade Area of \nthe Americas, targeted for completion in 2005. This year the United \nStates will advocate market-access negotiations with its partners, \ntargeted on agriculture, industrial goods, services, investment, and \ngovernment procurement. We will also offer more opportunity to the \npoorest continent, Africa, starting with full use of the preferences \nallowed in the African Growth and Opportunity Act, and leading to free \ntrade.\n\n*\tMove ahead with bilateral free trade agreements. Building on the \nfree trade agreement with Jordan enacted in 2001, the Administration \nwill work this year to complete free trade agreements with Chile and \nSingapore. Our aim is to achieve free trade agreements with a mix of \ndeveloped and developing countries in all regions of the world. \nInitially, Central America, Southern Africa, Morocco, and Australia will \nbe our principal focal points.\n\n*\tRenew the executive-congressional partnership. Every \nadministration\u0027s trade strategy depends on a productive partnership with \nCongress. After a gap of 8 years, the Administration reestablished \nmajority support in the Congress for trade liberalization by passing \nTrade Promotion Authority and the other market opening measures for \ndeveloping countries in the Trade Act of 2002. This Administration will \nwork with Congress to enact new bilateral, regional, and global trade \nagreements that will be concluded under the recently passed Trade \nPromotion Authority.\n\n*\tPromote the connection between trade and development. Trade \npolicies can help developing countries strengthen property rights, \ncompetition, the rule of law, investment, the spread of knowledge, open \nsocieties, the efficient allocation of resources, and regional \nintegration -- all leading to growth, opportunity, and confidence in \ndeveloping countries. The United States is implementing The Africa \nGrowth and Opportunity Act to provide market-access for nearly all goods \nproduced in the 35 countries of sub-Saharan Africa. We will make more \nuse of this act and its equivalent for the Caribbean Basin and continue \nto work with multilateral and regional institutions to help poorer \ncountries take advantage of these opportunities. Beyond market access, \nthe most important area where trade intersects with poverty is in public \nhealth. We will ensure that the WTO intellectual property rules are \nflexible enough to allow developing nations to gain access to critical \nmedicines for extraordinary dangers like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and \nmalaria.\n\n*\tEnforce trade agreements and laws against unfair practices. \nCommerce depends on the rule of law; international trade depends on \nenforceable agreements. Our top priorities are to resolve ongoing \ndisputes with the European Union, Canada, and Mexico and to make a \nglobal effort to address new technology, science, and health regulations \nthat needlessly impede farm exports and improved agriculture. Laws \nagainst unfair trade practices are often abused, but the international \ncommunity must be able to address genuine concerns about government \nsubsidies and dumping. International industrial espionage which \nundermines fair competition must be detected and deterred.\n\n*\tHelp domestic industries and workers adjust. There is a sound \nstatutory framework for these transitional safeguards which we have used \nin the agricultural sector and which we are using this year to help the \nAmerican steel industry. The benefits of free trade depend upon the \nenforcement of fair trading practices. These safeguards help ensure that \nthe benefits of free trade do not come at the expense of American \nworkers. Trade adjustment assistance will help workers adapt to the \nchange and dynamism of open markets.\n\n*\tProtect the environment and workers. The United States must foster \neconomic growth in ways that will provide a better life along with \nwidening prosperity. We will incorporate labor and environmental \nconcerns into U.S. trade negotiations, creating a healthy \"network\" \nbetween multilateral environmental agreements with the WTO, and use the \nInternational Labor Organization, trade preference programs, and trade \ntalks to improve working conditions in conjunction with freer trade.\n\n*\tEnhance energy security. We will strengthen our own energy security \nand the shared prosperity of the global economy by working with our \nallies, trading partners, and energy producers to expand the sources and \ntypes of global energy supplied, especially in the Western Hemisphere, \nAfrica, Central Asia, and the Caspian region. We will also continue to \nwork with our partners to develop cleaner and more energy efficient \ntechnologies.\n\n\nEconomic growth should be accompanied by global efforts to stabilize \ngreenhouse gas concentrations associated with this growth, containing \nthem at a level that prevents dangerous human interference with the \nglobal climate. Our overall objective is to reduce America\u0027s greenhouse \ngas emissions relative to the size of our economy, cutting such \nemissions per unit of economic activity by 18 percent over the next 10 \nyears, by the year 2012. Our strategies for attaining this goal will be \nto:\n\n*\tremain committed to the basic U.N. Framework Convention for \ninternational cooperation;\n\n*\tobtain agreements with key industries to cut emissions of some of \nthe most potent greenhouse gases and give transferable credits to \ncompanies that can show real cuts;\n\n*\tdevelop improved standards for measuring and registering emission \nreductions;\n\n*\tpromote renewable energy production and clean coal technology, as \nwell as nuclear power -- which produces no greenhouse gas emissions, \nwhile also improving fuel economy for U.S. cars and trucks;\n\n*\tincrease spending on research and new conservation technologies, to \na total of $4.5 billion -- the largest sum being spent on climate change \nby any country in the world and a $700 million increase over last year\u0027s \nbudget; and\n\n*\tassist developing countries, especially the major greenhouse gas \nemitters such as China and India, so that they will have the tools and \nresources to join this effort and be able to grow along a cleaner and \nbetter path.\n\n\nVII. Expand the Circle of Development by Opening Societies and Building \nthe Infrastructure of Democracy\n\n\n\"In World War II we fought to make the world safer, then worked to \nrebuild it. As we wage war today to keep the world safe from terror, we \nmust also work to make the world a better place for all its citizens.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Bush\nWashington, D.C. (Inter-American\nDevelopment Bank)\nMarch 14, 2002\n\n\n\nA world where some live in comfort and plenty, while half of the human \nrace lives on less than $2 a day, is neither just nor stable. Including \nall of the world\u0027s poor in an expanding circle of development -- and \nopportunity -- is a moral imperative and one of the top priorities of \nU.S. international policy.\n\nDecades of massive development assistance have failed to spur economic \ngrowth in the poorest countries. Worse, development aid has often served \nto prop up failed policies, relieving the pressure for reform and \nperpetuating misery. Results of aid are typically measured in dollars \nspent by donors, not in the rates of growth and poverty reduction \nachieved by recipients. These are the indicators of a failed strategy.\n\nWorking with other nations, the United States is confronting this \nfailure. We forged a new consensus at the U.N. Conference on Financing \nfor Development in Monterrey that the objectives of assistance -- and \nthe strategies to achieve those objectives -- must change.\n\nThis Administration\u0027s goal is to help unleash the productive potential \nof individuals in all nations. Sustained growth and poverty reduction is \nimpossible without the right national policies. Where governments have \nimplemented real policy changes we will provide significant new levels \nof assistance. The United States and other developed countries should \nset an ambitious and specific target: to double the size of the world\u0027s \npoorest economies within a decade.\n\nThe United States Government will pursue these major strategies to \nachieve this goal:\n\n*\tProvide resources to aid countries that have met the challenge of \nnational reform. We propose a 50 percent increase in the core \ndevelopment assistance given by the United States. While continuing our \npresent programs, including humanitarian assistance based on need alone, \nthese billions of new dollars will form a new Millennium Challenge \nAccount for projects in countries whose governments rule justly, invest \nin their people, and encourage economic freedom. Governments must fight \ncorruption, respect basic human rights, embrace the rule of law, invest \nin health care and education, follow responsible economic policies, and \nenable entrepreneurship. The Millennium Challenge Account will reward \ncountries that have demonstrated real policy change and challenge those \nthat have not to implement reforms.\n\n*\tImprove the effectiveness of the World Bank and other development \nbanks in raising living standards. The United States is committed to a \ncomprehensive reform agenda for making the World Bank and the other \nmultilateral development banks more effective in improving the lives of \nthe world\u0027s poor. We have reversed the downward trend in U.S. \ncontributions and proposed an 18 percent increase in the U.S. \ncontributions to the International Development Association (IDA) -- the \nWorld Bank\u0027s fund for the poorest countries -- and the African \nDevelopment Fund. The key to raising living standards and reducing \npoverty around the world is increasing productivity growth, especially \nin the poorest countries. We will continue to press the multilateral \ndevelopment banks to focus on activities that increase economic \nproductivity, such as improvements in education, health, rule of law, \nand private sector development. Every project, every loan, every grant \nmust be judged by how much it will increase productivity growth in \ndeveloping countries.\n\n*\tInsist upon measurable results to ensure that development \nassistance is actually making a difference in the lives of the world\u0027s \npoor. When it comes to economic development, what really matters is that \nmore children are getting a better education, more people have access to \nhealth care and clean water, or more workers can find jobs to make a \nbetter future for their families. We have a moral obligation to measure \nthe success of our development assistance by whether it is delivering \nresults. For this reason, we will continue to demand that our own \ndevelopment assistance as well as assistance from the multilateral \ndevelopment banks has measurable goals and concrete benchmarks for \nachieving those goals. Thanks to U.S. leadership, the recent IDA \nreplenishment agreement will establish a monitoring and evaluation \nsystem that measures recipient countries\u0027 progress. For the first time, \ndonors can link a portion of their contributions to IDA to the \nachievement of actual development results, and part of the U.S. \ncontribution is linked in this way. We will strive to make sure that the \nWorld Bank and other multilateral development banks build on this \nprogress so that a focus on results is an integral part of everything \nthat these institutions do.\n\n*\tIncrease the amount of development assistance that is provided in \nthe form of grants instead of loans. Greater use of results-based grants \nis the best way to help poor countries make productive investments, \nparticularly in the social sectors, without saddling them with \never-larger debt burdens. As a result of U.S. leadership, the recent IDA \nagreement provided for significant increases in grant funding for the \npoorest countries for education, HIV/AIDS, health, nutrition, water, \nsanitation, and other human needs. Our goal is to build on that progress \nby increasing the use of grants at the other multilateral development \nbanks. We will also challenge universities, nonprofits, and the private \nsector to match government efforts by using grants to support \ndevelopment projects that show results.\n\n*\tOpen societies to commerce and investment. Trade and investment are \nthe real engines of economic growth. Even if government aid increases, \nmost money for development must come from trade, domestic capital, and \nforeign investment. An effective strategy must try to expand these flows \nas well. Free markets and free trade are key priorities of our national \nsecurity strategy.\n\n*\tSecure public health. The scale of the public health crisis in poor \ncountries is enormous. In countries afflicted by epidemics and pandemics \nlike HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, growth and development will be \nthreatened until these scourges can be contained. Resources from the \ndeveloped world are necessary but will be effective only with honest \ngovernance, which supports prevention programs and provides effective \nlocal infrastructure. The United States has strongly backed the new \nglobal fund for HIV/AIDS organized by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan \nand its focus on combining prevention with a broad strategy for \ntreatment and care. The United States already contributes more than \ntwice as much money to such efforts as the next largest donor. If the \nglobal fund demonstrates its promise, we will be ready to give even more.\n\n*\tEmphasize education. Literacy and learning are the foundation of \ndemocracy and development. Only about 7 percent of World Bank resources \nare devoted to education. This proportion should grow. The United States \nwill increase its own funding for education assistance by at least 20 \npercent with an emphasis on improving basic education and teacher \ntraining in Africa. The United States can also bring information \ntechnology to these societies, many of whose education systems have been \ndevastated by AIDS.\n\n*\tContinue to aid agricultural development. New technologies, \nincluding biotechnology, have enormous potential to improve crop yields \nin developing countries while using fewer pesticides and less water. \nUsing sound science, the United States should help bring these benefits \nto the 800 million people, including 300 million children, who still \nsuffer from hunger and malnutrition.\n\n\nVIII. Develop Agendas for Cooperative Action with the Other Main Centers \nof Global Power\n\n\n\"We have our best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the 17th \ncentury to build a world where the great powers compete in peace instead \nof prepare for war.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Bush\nWest Point, New York\nJune 1, 2002\n\n\n\nAmerica will implement its strategies by organizing coalitions -- as \nbroad as practicable -- of states able and willing to promote a balance \nof power that favors freedom. Effective coalition leadership requires \nclear priorities, an appreciation of others\u0027 interests, and consistent \nconsultations among partners with a spirit of humility.\n\nThere is little of lasting consequence that the United States can \naccomplish in the world without the sustained cooperation of its allies \nand friends in Canada and Europe. Europe is also the seat of two of the \nstrongest and most able international institutions in the world: the \nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which has, since its \ninception, been the fulcrum of transatlantic and inter-European \nsecurity, and the European Union (EU), our partner in opening world \ntrade.\n\nThe attacks of September 11 were also an attack on NATO, as NATO itself \nrecognized when it invoked its Article V self-defense clause for the \nfirst time. NATO\u0027s core mission -- collective defense of the \ntransatlantic alliance of democracies -- remains, but NATO must develop \nnew structures and capabilities to carry out that mission under new \ncircumstances. NATO must build a capability to field, at short notice, \nhighly mobile, specially trained forces whenever they are needed to \nrespond to a threat against any member of the alliance.\n\nThe alliance must be able to act wherever our interests are threatened, \ncreating coalitions under NATO\u0027s own mandate, as well as contributing to \nmission-based coalitions. To achieve this, we must:\n\n*\texpand NATO\u0027s membership to those democratic nations willing and \nable to share the burden of defending and advancing our common interests;\n\n*\tensure that the military forces of NATO nations have appropriate \ncombat contributions to make in coalition warfare;\n\n*\tdevelop planning processes to enable those contributions to become \neffective multinational fighting forces;\n\n*\ttake advantage of the technological opportunities and economies of \nscale in our defense spending to transform NATO military forces so that \nthey dominate potential aggressors and diminish our vulnerabilities;\n\n*\tstreamline and increase the flexibility of command structures to \nmeet new operational demands and the associated requirements of \ntraining, integrating, and experimenting with new force configurations; \nand\n\n*\tmaintain the ability to work and fight together as allies even as \nwe take the necessary steps to transform and modernize our forces.\n\n\nIf NATO succeeds in enacting these changes, the rewards will be a \npartnership as central to the security and interests of its member \nstates as was the case during the Cold War. We will sustain a common \nperspective on the threats to our societies and improve our ability to \ntake common action in defense of our nations and their interests. At the \nsame time, we welcome our European allies\u0027 efforts to forge a greater \nforeign policy and defense identity with the EU, and commit ourselves to \nclose consultations to ensure that these developments work with NATO. We \ncannot afford to lose this opportunity to better prepare the family of \ntransatlantic democracies for the challenges to come.\n\nThe attacks of September 11 energized America\u0027s Asian alliances. \nAustralia invoked the ANZUS Treaty to declare the September 11 was an \nattack on Australia itself, following that historic decision with the \ndispatch of some of the world\u0027s finest combat forces for Operation \nEnduring Freedom. Japan and the Republic of Korea provided unprecedented \nlevels of military logistical support within weeks of the terrorist \nattack. We have deepened cooperation on counter-terrorism with our \nalliance partners in Thailand and the Philippines and received \ninvaluable assistance from close friends like Singapore and New Zealand.\n\nThe war against terrorism has proven that America\u0027s alliances in Asia \nnot only underpin regional peace and stability, but are flexible and \nready to deal with new challenges. To enhance our Asian alliances and \nfriendships, we will:\n\n\n*\tlook to Japan to continue forging a leading role in regional and \nglobal affairs based on our common interests, our common values, and our \nclose defense and diplomatic cooperation;\n\n*\twork with South Korea to maintain vigilance towards the North while \npreparing our alliance to make contributions to the broader stability of \nthe region over the longer-term;\n\n*\tbuild on 50 years of U.S.-Australian alliance cooperation as we \ncontinue working together to resolve regional and global problems -- as \nwe have so many times from the Battle of Leyte Gulf to Tora Bora;\n\n*\tmaintain forces in the region that reflect our commitments to our \nallies, our requirements, our technological advances, and the strategic \nenvironment; and\n\n*\tbuild on stability provided by these alliances, as well as with \ninstitutions such as ASEAN and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation \nforum, to develop a mix of regional and bilateral strategies to manage \nchange in this dynamic region.\n\n\nWe are attentive to the possible renewal of old patterns of great power \ncompetition. Several potential great powers are now in the midst of \ninternal transition -- most importantly Russia, India, and China. In all \nthree cases, recent developments have encouraged our hope that a truly \nglobal consensus about basic principles is slowly taking shape.\n\nWith Russia, we are already building a new strategic relationship based \non a central reality of the twenty-first century: the United States and \nRussia are no longer strategic adversaries. The Moscow Treaty on \nStrategic Reductions is emblematic of this new reality and reflects a \ncritical change in Russian thinking that promises to lead to productive, \nlong-term relations with the Euro-Atlantic community and the United \nStates. Russia\u0027s top leaders have a realistic assessment of their \ncountry\u0027s current weakness and the policies -- internal and external -- \nneeded to reverse those weaknesses. They understand, increasingly, that \nCold War approaches do not serve their national interests and that \nRussian and American strategic interests overlap in many areas.\n\nUnited States policy seeks to use this turn in Russian thinking to \nrefocus our relationship on emerging and potential common interests and \nchallenges. We are broadening our already extensive cooperation in the \nglobal war on terrorism. We are facilitating Russia\u0027s entry into the \nWorld Trade Organization, without lowering standards for accession, to \npromote beneficial bilateral trade and investment relations. We have \ncreated the NATO-Russia Council with the goal of deepening security \ncooperation among Russia, our European allies, and ourselves. We will \ncontinue to bolster the independence and stability of the states of the \nformer Soviet Union in the belief that a prosperous and stable \nneighborhood will reinforce Russia\u0027s growing commitment to integration \ninto the Euro-Atlantic community.\n\nAt the same time, we are realistic about the differences that still \ndivide us from Russia and about the time and effort it will take to \nbuild an enduring strategic partnership. Lingering distrust of our \nmotives and policies by key Russian elites slows improvement in our \nrelations. Russia\u0027s uneven commitment to the basic values of free-market \ndemocracy and dubious record in combating the proliferation of weapons \nof mass destruction remain matters of great concern. Russia\u0027s very \nweakness limits the opportunities for cooperation. Nevertheless, those \nopportunities are vastly greater now than in recent years -- or even \ndecades.\n\nThe United States has undertaken a transformation in its bilateral \nrelationship with India based on a conviction that U.S. interests \nrequire a strong relationship with India. We are the two largest \ndemocracies, committed to political freedom protected by representative \ngovernment. India is moving toward greater economic freedom as well. We \nhave a common interest in the free flow of commerce, including through \nthe vital sea lanes of the Indian Ocean. Finally, we share an interest \nin fighting terrorism and in creating a strategically stable Asia.\n\nDifferences remain, including over the development of India\u0027s nuclear \nand missile programs, and the pace of India\u0027s economic reforms. But \nwhile in the past these concerns may have dominated our thinking about \nIndia, today we start with a view of India as a growing world power with \nwhich we have common strategic interests. Through a strong partnership \nwith India, we can best address any differences and shape a dynamic \nfuture.\n\nThe United States relationship with China is an important part of our \nstrategy to promote a stable, peaceful, and prosperous Asia-Pacific \nregion. We welcome the emergence of a strong, peaceful, and prosperous \nChina. The democratic development of China is crucial to that future. \nYet, a quarter century after beginning the process of shedding the worst \nfeatures of the Communist legacy, China\u0027s leaders have not yet made the \nnext series of fundamental choices about the character of their state. \nIn pursuing advanced military capabilities that can threaten its \nneighbors in the Asia-Pacific region, China is following an outdated \npath that, in the end, will hamper its own pursuit of national \ngreatness. In time, China will find that social and political freedom is \nthe only source of that greatness.\n\nThe United States seeks a constructive relationship with a changing \nChina. We already cooperate well where our interests overlap, including \nthe current war on terrorism and in promoting stability on the Korean \npeninsula. Likewise, we have coordinated on the future of Afghanistan \nand have initiated a comprehensive dialogue on counter-terrorism and \nsimilar transitional concerns. Shared health and environmental threats, \nsuch as the spread of HIV/AIDS, challenge us to promote jointly the \nwelfare of our citizens.\n\nAddressing these transnational threats will challenge China to become \nmore open with information, promote the development of civil society, \nand enhance individual human rights. China has begun to take the road to \npolitical openness, permitting many personal freedoms and conducting \nvillage-level elections, yet remains strongly committed to national \none-party rule by the Communist Party. To make that nation truly \naccountable to its citizen\u0027s needs and aspirations, however, much work \nremains to be done. Only by allowing the Chinese people to think, \nassemble, and worship freely can China reach its full potential.\n\nOur important trade relationship will benefit from China\u0027s entry into \nthe World Trade Organization, which will create more export \nopportunities and ultimately more jobs for American farmers, workers, \nand companies. China is our fourth largest trading partner, with over \n$100 billion in annual two-way trade. The power of market principles and \nthe WTO\u0027s requirements for transparency and accountability will advance \nopenness and the rule of law in China to help establish basic \nprotections for commerce and for citizens. There are, however, other \nareas in which we have profound disagreements. Our commitment to the \nself-defense of Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act is one. Human \nrights is another. We expect China to adhere to its nonproliferation \ncommitments. We will work to narrow differences where they exist, but \nnot allow them to preclude cooperation where we agree.\n\nThe events of September 11, 2001, fundamentally changed the context for \nrelations between the United States and other main centers of global \npower, and opened vast, new opportunities. With our long-standing allies \nin Europe and Asia, and with leaders in Russia, India, and China, we \nmust develop active agendas of cooperation lest these relationships \nbecome routine and unproductive.\n\nEvery agency of the United States Government shares the challenge. We \ncan build fruitful habits of consultation, quiet argument, sober \nanalysis, and common action. In the long-term, these are the practices \nthat will sustain the supremacy of our common principles and keep open \nthe path of progress.\n\nIX. Transform America\u0027s National Security Institutions to Meet the \nChallenges and Opportunities of the Twenty-First Century\n\n\n\"Terrorists attacked a symbol of American prosperity. They did not touch \nits source. America is successful because of the hard work, creativity, \nand enterprise of our people.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Bush\nWashington, D.C. (Joint Session of Congress)\nSeptember 20, 2001\n\n\n\nThe major institutions of American national security were designed in a \ndifferent era to meet different requirements. All of them must be \ntransformed.\n\nIt is time to reaffirm the essential role of American military strength. \nWe must build and maintain our defenses beyond challenge. Our military\u0027s \nhighest priority is to defend the United States. To do so effectively, \nour military must:\n\n*\tassure our allies and friends;\n\n*\tdissuade future military competition;\n\n*\tdeter threats against U.S. interests, allies, and friends; and\n\n*\tdecisively defeat any adversary if deterrence fails.\n\n\nThe unparalleled strength of the United States armed forces, and their \nforward presence, have maintained the peace in some of the world\u0027s most \nstrategically vital regions. However, the threats and enemies we must \nconfront have changed, and so must our forces. A military structured to \ndeter massive Cold War-era armies must be transformed to focus more on \nhow an adversary might fight rather than where and when a war might \noccur. We will channel our energies to overcome a host of operational \nchallenges.\n\nThe presence of American forces overseas is one of the most profound \nsymbols of the U.S. commitments to allies and friends. Through our \nwillingness to use force in our own defense and in defense of others, \nthe United States demonstrates its resolve to maintain a balance of \npower that favors freedom. To contend with uncertainty and to meet the \nmany security challenges we face, the United States will require bases \nand stations within and beyond Western Europe and Northeast Asia, as \nwell as temporary access arrangements for the long-distance deployment \nof U.S. forces.\n\nBefore the war in Afghanistan, that area was low on the list of major \nplanning contingencies. Yet, in a very short time, we had to operate \nacross the length and breadth of that remote nation, using every branch \nof the armed forces. We must prepare for more such deployments by \ndeveloping assets such as advanced remote sensing, long-range precision \nstrike capabilities, and transformed maneuver and expeditionary forces. \nThis broad portfolio of military capabilities must also include the \nability to defend the homeland, conduct information operations, ensure \nU.S. access to distant theaters, and protect critical U.S. \ninfrastructure and assets in outer space.\n\nInnovation within the armed forces will rest on experimentation with new \napproaches to warfare, strengthening joint operations, exploiting U.S. \nintelligence advantages, and taking full advantage of science and \ntechnology. We must also transform the way the Department of Defense is \nrun, especially in financial management and recruitment and retention. \nFinally, while maintaining near-term readiness and the ability to fight \nthe war on terrorism, the goal must be to provide the President with a \nwider range of military options to discourage aggression or any form of \ncoercion against the United States, our allies, and our friends.\n\nWe know from history that deterrence can fail; and we know from \nexperience that some enemies cannot be deterred. The United States must \nand will maintain the capability to defeat any attempt by an enemy -- \nwhether a state or non-state actor -- to impose its will on the United \nStates, our allies, or our friends. We will maintain the forces \nsufficient to support our obligations, and to defend freedom. Our forces \nwill be strong enough to dissuade potential adversaries from pursuing a \nmilitary build-up in hopes of surpassing, or equaling, the power of the \nUnited States.\n\nIntelligence -- and how we use it -- is our first line of defense \nagainst terrorists and the threat posed by hostile states. Designed \naround the priority of gathering enormous information about a massive, \nfixed object -- the Soviet bloc -- the intelligence community is coping \nwith the challenge of following a far more complex and elusive set of \ntargets.\n\nWe must transform our intelligence capabilities and build new ones to \nkeep pace with the nature of these threats. Intelligence must be \nappropriately integrated with our defense and law enforcement systems \nand coordinated with our allies and friends. We need to protect the \ncapabilities we have so that we do not arm our enemies with the \nknowledge of how best to surprise us. Those who would harm us also seek \nthe benefit of surprise to limit our prevention and response options and \nto maximize injury.\n\nWe must strengthen intelligence warning and analysis to provide \nintegrated threat assessments for national and homeland security. Since \nthe threats inspired by foreign governments and groups may be conducted \ninside the United States, we must also ensure the proper fusion of \ninformation between intelligence and law enforcement.\n\nInitiatives in this area will include:\n\n*\tstrengthening the authority of the Director of Central Intelligence \nto lead the development and actions of the Nation\u0027s foreign intelligence \ncapabilities;\n\n*\testablishing a new framework for intelligence warning that provides \nseamless and integrated warning across the spectrum of threats facing \nthe nation and our allies;\n\n*\tcontinuing to develop new methods of collecting information to \nsustain our intelligence advantage;\n\n*\tinvesting in future capabilities while working to protect them \nthrough a more vigorous effort to prevent the compromise of intelligence \ncapabilities; and\n\n*\tcollecting intelligence against the terrorist danger across the \ngovernment with all-source analysis.\n\n\nAs the United States Government relies on the armed forces to defend \nAmerica\u0027s interests, it must rely on diplomacy to interact with other \nnations. We will ensure that the Department of State receives funding \nsufficient to ensure the success of American diplomacy. The State \nDepartment takes the lead in managing our bilateral relationships with \nother governments. And in this new era, its people and institutions must \nbe able to interact equally adroitly with non-governmental organizations \nand international institutions. Officials trained mainly in \ninternational politics must also extend their reach to understand \ncomplex issues of domestic governance around the world, including public \nhealth, education, law enforcement, the judiciary, and public diplomacy.\n\nOur diplomats serve at the front line of complex negotiations, civil \nwars, and other humanitarian catastrophes. As humanitarian relief \nrequirements are better understood, we must also be able to help build \npolice forces, court systems, and legal codes, local and provincial \ngovernment institutions, and electoral systems. Effective international \ncooperation is needed to accomplish these goals, backed by American \nreadiness to play our part.\n\nJust as our diplomatic institutions must adapt so that we can reach out \nto others, we also need a different and more comprehensive approach to \npublic information efforts that can help people around the world learn \nabout and understand America. The war on terrorism is not a clash of \ncivilizations. It does, however, reveal the clash inside a civilization, \na battle for the future of the Muslim world. This is a struggle of ideas \nand this is an area where America must excel.\n\nWe will take the actions necessary to ensure that our efforts to meet \nour global security commitments and protect Americans are not impaired \nby the potential for investigations, inquiry, or prosecution by the \nInternational Criminal Court (ICC), whose jurisdiction does not extend \nto Americans and which we do not accept. We will work together with \nother nations to avoid complications in our military operations and \ncooperation, through such mechanisms as multilateral and bilateral \nagreements that will protect U.S. nationals from the ICC. We will \nimplement fully the American Servicemembers Protection Act, whose \nprovisions are intended to ensure and enhance the protection of U.S. \npersonnel and officials.\n\nWe will make hard choices in the coming year and beyond to ensure the \nright level and allocation of government spending on national security. \nThe United States Government must strengthen its defenses to win this \nwar. At home, our most important priority is to protect the homeland for \nthe American people.\n\nToday, the distinction between domestic and foreign affairs is \ndiminishing. In a globalized world, events beyond America\u0027s borders have \na greater impact inside them. Our society must be open to people, ideas, \nand goods from across the globe. The characteristics we most cherish -- \nour freedom, our cities, our systems of movement, and modern life -- are \nvulnerable to terrorism. This vulnerability will persist long after we \nbring to justice those responsible for the September eleventh attacks. \nAs time passes, individuals may gain access to means of destruction that \nuntil now could be wielded only by armies, fleets, and squadrons. This \nis a new condition of life. We will adjust to it and thrive -- in spite \nof it.\n\nIn exercising our leadership, we will respect the values, judgment, and \ninterests of our friends and partners. Still, we will be prepared to act \napart when our interests and unique responsibilities require. When we \ndisagree on particulars, we will explain forthrightly the grounds for \nour concerns and strive to forge viable alternatives. We will not allow \nsuch disagreements to obscure our determination to secure together, with \nour allies and our friends, our shared fundamental interests and values.\n\nUltimately, the foundation of American strength is at home. It is in the \nskills of our people, the dynamism of our economy, and the resilience of \nour institutions. A diverse, modern society has inherent, ambitious, \nentrepreneurial energy. Our strength comes from what we do with that \nenergy. That is where our national security begins.\n\n",

Perhaps the most fundamental thing to realize about\n\u003e life on Earth today.\n\u003e\n\u003e The following is a fascinating document of official Government policy\n\u003e that bears close reading. It is the aspirations of a wonderful nation in\n\u003e an imperfect world.\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003e  The war on terrorism is not a clash of civilizations. It does,\n\u003e \u003e however, reveal the clash inside a civilization, a battle for the\n\u003e \u003e future of the Muslim world. This is a struggle of ideas and this is an\n\u003e \u003e area where America must excel.\n\u003e\n\u003e I was recently at a lecture about the surprising success of Radio Sawa,\n\u003e our new music-and-news channel for 15-30 year old Arabs. It\u0027s #1 in\n\u003e practically every market it\u0027s entered, nearing 90% listenership in\n\u003e Amman. And it\u0027s even beginning to be trusted for news, well past BBC and\n\u003e taking share from every other government broadcaster.\n\u003e\n\u003e It is as hard to imagine America losing a war of ideas in the long-term\n\u003e as it is to imagine America making any headway at all in the short term.\n\u003e\n\u003e Many of you may disagree, but I found the document below surprisingly\n\u003e centrist. If you know the code, you can hear clearly partisan tones, re:\n\u003e ICC, Taiwan Relations Act, etc. But, still, this is as much a Democratic\n\u003e platform as not. Africa and AIDS take up more mindshare than I feared\n\u003e they might.\n\u003e\n\u003e As you read, replace \"United States\" with \"Roman Empire\" and it may make\n\u003e as much sense, in the long view of history. I don\u0027t know how proud to be\n\u003e about that, but it is telling. Sometime I daydream that the President\n\u003e might sit down with the nation with Perotista flip charts and explain to\n\u003e our citizens the sheer vastness of our 700+ military installations\n\u003e overseas and what they do for us. It would be a powerful education on\n\u003e how engaged we are in the world around us.\n\u003e\n\u003e Heck, I\u0027d love to see a real-time map of Federal expenditures around the\n\u003e globe, a softly glowing necklace of embassies, carriers, arctic research\n\u003e stations, hotels, golf courses, warehouses, libraries, clinics and all\n\u003e the rest of the influence a trillion dollars here or there can buy.\n\u003e\n\u003e Of course, this still doesn\u0027t leave me any more comfortable with the\n\u003e real news in this document: the Bush Doctrine for pre-emptive strikes.\n\u003e I\u0027d sooner repeal the Church amendments on covert action than permit\n\u003e such a principle to be loosed upon the world.\n\u003e\n\u003e Rohit\n\u003e\n\u003e -----------------------------------------------------\n\u003e September 20, 2002\n\u003e\n\u003e Full Text: Bush\u0027s National Security Strategy\n\u003e\n\u003e Following is the full text of President Bush\u0027s new national security\n\u003e strategy. The document, entitled \"The National Security Strategy of the\n\u003e United States,\" will soon be transmitted to Congress as a declaration of\n\u003e the Administration\u0027s policy.\n\u003e\n\u003e INTRODUCTION\n\u003e\n\u003e THE great struggles of the twentieth century between liberty and\n\u003e totalitarianism ended with a decisive victory for the forces of\n\u003e freedom -- and a single sustainable model for national success: freedom,\n\u003e democracy, and free enterprise. In the twenty-first century, only\n\u003e nations that share a commitment to protecting basic human rights and\n\u003e guaranteeing political and economic freedom will be able to unleash the\n\u003e potential of their people and assure their future prosperity. People\n\u003e everywhere want to say what they think; choose who will govern them;\n\u003e worship as they please; educate their children -- male and female; own\n\u003e property; and enjoy the benefits of their labor. These values of freedom\n\u003e are right and true for every user, in every society -- and the duty of\n\u003e protecting these values against their enemies is the common calling of\n\u003e freedom-loving people across the globe and across the ages.\n\u003e\n\u003e Today, the United States enjoys a position of unparalleled military\n\u003e strength and great economic and political influence. In keeping with our\n\u003e heritage and principles, we do not use our strength to press for\n\u003e unilateral advantage. We seek instead to create a balance of power that\n\u003e favors human freedom: conditions in which all nations and all societies\n\u003e can choose for themselves the rewards and challenges of political and\n\u003e economic liberty. By making the world safer, we allow the people of the\n\u003e world to make their own lives better. We will defend this just peace\n\u003e against threats from terrorists and tyrants. We will preserve the peace\n\u003e by building good relations among the great powers. We will extend the\n\u003e peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent.\n\u003e\n\u003e Defending our Nation against its enemies is the first and fundamental\n\u003e commitment of the Federal Government. Today, that task has changed\n\u003e dramatically. Enemies in the past needed great armies and great\n\u003e industrial capabilities to endanger America. Now, shadowy networks of\n\u003e individuals can bring great chaos and suffering to our shores for less\n\u003e than it costs to purchase a single tank. Terrorists are organized to\n\u003e penetrate open societies and to turn the power of modern technologies\n\u003e against us.\n\u003e\n\u003e To defeat this threat we must make use of every tool in our arsenal --\n\u003e from better homeland defenses and law enforcement to intelligence and\n\u003e cutting off terrorist financing. The war against terrorists of global\n\u003e reach is a global enterprise of uncertain duration. America will help\n\u003e nations that need our assistance in combating terror. And America will\n\u003e hold to account nations that are compromised by terror -- because the\n\u003e allies of terror are the enemies of civilization. The United States and\n\u003e countries cooperating with us must not allow the terrorists to develop\n\u003e new home bases. Together, we will seek to deny them sanctuary at every\n\u003e turn.\n\u003e\n\u003e The gravest danger our Nation faces lies at the crossroads of radicalism\n\u003e and technology. Our enemies have openly declared that they are seeking\n\u003e weapons of mass destruction, and evidence indicates that they are doing\n\u003e so with determination. The United States will not allow these efforts to\n\u003e succeed. We will build defenses against ballistic missiles and other\n\u003e means of delivery. We will cooperate with other nations to deny,\n\u003e contain, and curtail our enemies\u0027 efforts to acquire dangerous\n\u003e technologies. And, as a matter of common sense and self-defense, America\n\u003e will act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed. We\n\u003e cannot defend America and our friends by hoping for the best. So we must\n\u003e be prepared to defeat our enemies\u0027 plans, using the best intelligence\n\u003e and proceeding with deliberation. History will judge harshly those who\n\u003e saw this coming danger but failed to act. In the new world we have\n\u003e entered, the only path to safety is the path of action.\n\u003e\n\u003e As we defend the peace, we will also take advantage of an historic\n\u003e opportunity to preserve the peace. Today, the international community\n\u003e has the best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the\n\u003e seventeenth century to build a world where great powers compete in peace\n\u003e instead of continually prepare for war. Today, the world\u0027s great powers\n\u003e find ourselves on the same side -- united by common dangers of terrorist\n\u003e violence and chaos. The United States will build on these common\n\u003e interests to promote global security. We are also increasingly united by\n\u003e common values. Russia is in the midst of a hopeful transition, reaching\n\u003e for its democratic future and a partner in the war on terror. Chinese\n\u003e leaders are discovering that economic freedom is the only source of\n\u003e national wealth. In time, they will find that social and political\n\u003e freedom is the only source of national greatness. America will encourage\n\u003e the advancement of democracy and economic openness in both nations,\n\u003e because these are the best foundations for domestic stability and\n\u003e international order. We will strongly resist aggression from other great\n\u003e powers -- even as we welcome their peaceful pursuit of prosperity,\n\u003e trade, and cultural advancement.\n\u003e\n\u003e Finally, the United States will use this moment of opportunity to extend\n\u003e the benefits of freedom across the globe. We will actively work to bring\n\u003e the hope of democracy, development, free markets, and free trade to\n\u003e every corner of the world. The events of September 11, 2001, taught us\n\u003e that weak states, like Afghanistan, can pose as great a danger to our\n\u003e national interests as strong states. Poverty does not make poor people\n\u003e into terrorists and murderers. Yet poverty, weak institutions, and\n\u003e corruption can make weak states vulnerable to terrorist networks and\n\u003e drug cartels within their borders.\n\u003e\n\u003e The United States will stand beside any nation determined to build a\n\u003e better future by seeking the rewards of liberty for its people. Free\n\u003e trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift whole societies\n\u003e out of poverty -- so the United States will work with individual\n\u003e nations, entire regions, and the entire global trading community to\n\u003e build a world that trades in freedom and therefore grows in prosperity.\n\u003e The United States will deliver greater development assistance through\n\u003e the New Millennium Challenge Account to nations that govern justly,\n\u003e invest in their people, and encourage economic freedom. We will also\n\u003e continue to lead the world in efforts to reduce the terrible toll of\n\u003e AIDS and other infectious diseases.\n\u003e\n\u003e In building a balance of power that favors freedom, the United States is\n\u003e guided by the conviction that all nations have important\n\u003e responsibilities. Nations that enjoy freedom must actively fight terror.\n\u003e Nations that depend on international stability must help prevent the\n\u003e spread of weapons of mass destruction. Nations that seek international\n\u003e aid must govern themselves wisely, so that aid is well spent. For\n\u003e freedom to thrive, accountability must be expected and required.\n\u003e\n\u003e We are also guided by the conviction that no nation can build a safer,\n\u003e better world alone. Alliances and multilateral institutions can multiply\n\u003e the strength of freedom-loving nations. The United States is committed\n\u003e to lasting institutions like the United Nations, the World Trade\n\u003e Organization, the Organization of American States, and NATO as well as\n\u003e other long-standing alliances. Coalitions of the willing can augment\n\u003e these permanent institutions. In all cases, international obligations\n\u003e are to be taken seriously. They are not to be undertaken symbolically to\n\u003e rally support for an ideal without furthering its attainment.\n\u003e\n\u003e Freedom is the non-negotiable demand of human dignity; the birthright of\n\u003e every user -- in every civilization. Throughout history, freedom has\n\u003e been threatened by war and terror; it has been challenged by the\n\u003e clashing wills of powerful states and the evil designs of tyrants; and\n\u003e it has been tested by widespread poverty and disease. Today, humanity\n\u003e holds in its hands the opportunity to further freedom\u0027s triumph over all\n\u003e these foes. The United States welcomes our responsibility to lead in\n\u003e this great mission.\n\u003e\n\u003e I. Overview of America\u0027s International Strategy\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e \"Our Nation\u0027s cause has always been larger than our Nation\u0027s defense. We\n\u003e fight, as we always fight, for a just peace -- a peace that favors\n\u003e liberty. We will defend the peace against the threats from terrorists\n\u003e and tyrants. We will preserve the peace by building good relations among\n\u003e the great powers. And we will extend the peace by encouraging free and\n\u003e open societies on every continent.\"\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e President Bush\n\u003e West Point, New York\n\u003e June 1, 2002\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e The United States possesses unprecedented -- and unequaled -- strength\n\u003e and influence in the world. Sustained by faith in the principles of\n\u003e liberty, and the value of a free society, this position comes with\n\u003e unparalleled responsibilities, obligations, and opportunity. The great\n\u003e strength of this nation must be used to promote a balance of power that\n\u003e favors freedom.\n\u003e\n\u003e For most of the twentieth century, the world was divided by a great\n\u003e struggle over ideas: destructive totalitarian visions versus freedom and\n\u003e equality.\n\u003e\n\u003e That great struggle is over. The militant visions of class, nation, and\n\u003e race which promised utopia and delivered misery have been defeated and\n\u003e discredited. America is now threatened less by conquering states than we\n\u003e are by failing ones. We are menaced less by fleets and armies than by\n\u003e catastrophic technologies in the hands of the embittered few. We must\n\u003e defeat these threats to our Nation, allies, and friends.\n\u003e\n\u003e This is also a time of opportunity for America. We will work to\n\u003e translate this moment of influence into decades of peace, prosperity,\n\u003e and liberty. The U.S. national security strategy will be based on a\n\u003e distinctly American internationalism that reflects the union of our\n\u003e values and our national interests. The aim of this strategy is to help\n\u003e make the world not just safer but better. Our goals on the path to\n\u003e progress are clear: political and economic freedom, peaceful relations\n\u003e with other states, and respect for human dignity.\n\u003e\n\u003e And this path is not America\u0027s alone. It is open to all.\n\u003e\n\u003e To achieve these goals, the United States will:\n\u003e\n\u003e * champion aspirations for human dignity;\n\u003e\n\u003e * strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent\n\u003e attacks against us and our friends;\n\u003e\n\u003e * work with others to defuse regional conflicts;\n\u003e\n\u003e * prevent our enemies from threatening us, our allies, and our\n\u003e friends, with weapons of mass destruction;\n\u003e\n\u003e * ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and\n\u003e free trade;\n\u003e\n\u003e * expand the circle of development by opening societies and building\n\u003e the infrastructure of democracy;\n\u003e\n\u003e * develop agendas for cooperative action with other main centers of\n\u003e global power; and\n\u003e\n\u003e * transform America\u0027s national security institutions to meet the\n\u003e challenges and opportunities of the twenty-first century.\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e II. Champion Aspirations for Human Dignity\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e \"Some worry that it is somehow undiplomatic or impolite to speak the\n\u003e language of right and wrong. I disagree. Different circumstances require\n\u003e different methods, but not different moralities.\"\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e President Bush\n\u003e West Point, New York\n\u003e June 1, 2002\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e In pursuit of our goals, our first imperative is to clarify what we\n\u003e stand for: the United States must defend liberty and justice because\n\u003e these principles are right and true for all people everywhere. No nation\n\u003e owns these aspirations, and no nation is exempt from them. Fathers and\n\u003e mothers in all societies want their children to be educated and to live\n\u003e free from poverty and violence. No people on earth yearn to be\n\u003e oppressed, aspire to servitude, or eagerly await the midnight knock of\n\u003e the secret police.\n\u003e\n\u003e America must stand firmly for the nonnegotiable demands of human\n\u003e dignity: the rule of law; limits on the absolute power of the state;\n\u003e free speech; freedom of worship; equal justice; respect for women;\n\u003e religious and ethnic tolerance; and respect for private property.\n\u003e\n\u003e These demands can be met in many ways. America\u0027s constitution has served\n\u003e us well. Many other nations, with different histories and cultures,\n\u003e facing different circumstances, have successfully incorporated these\n\u003e core principles into their own systems of governance. History has not\n\u003e been kind to those nations which ignored or flouted the rights and\n\u003e aspirations of their people.\n\u003e\n\u003e Our own history is a long struggle to live up to our ideals. But even in\n\u003e our worst moments, the principles enshrined in the Declaration of\n\u003e Independence were there to guide us. As a result, America is not just a\n\u003e stronger, but is a freer and more just society.\n\u003e\n\u003e Today, these ideals are a lifeline to lonely defenders of liberty. And\n\u003e when openings arrive, we can encourage change -- as we did in central\n\u003e and eastern Europe between 1989 and 1991, or in Belgrade in 2000. When\n\u003e we see democratic processes take hold among our friends in Taiwan or in\n\u003e the Republic of Korea, and see elected leaders replace generals in Latin\n\u003e America and Africa, we see examples of how authoritarian systems can\n\u003e evolve, marrying local history and traditions with the principles we all\n\u003e cherish.\n\u003e\n\u003e Embodying lessons from our past and using the opportunity we have today,\n\u003e the national security strategy of the United States must start from\n\u003e these core beliefs and look outward for possibilities to expand liberty.\n\u003e\n\u003e Our principles will guide our government\u0027s decisions about international\n\u003e cooperation, the character of our foreign assistance, and the allocation\n\u003e of resources. They will guide our actions and our words in international\n\u003e bodies.\n\u003e\n\u003e We will:\n\u003e\n\u003e * speak out honestly about violations of the nonnegotiable demands of\n\u003e human dignity using our voice and vote in international institutions to\n\u003e advance freedom;\n\u003e\n\u003e * use our foreign aid to promote freedom and support those who\n\u003e struggle non-violently for it, ensuring that nations moving toward\n\u003e democracy are rewarded for the steps they take;\n\u003e\n\u003e * make freedom and the development of democratic institutions key\n\u003e themes in our bilateral relations, seeking solidarity and cooperation\n\u003e from other democracies while we press governments that deny human rights\n\u003e to move toward a better future; and\n\u003e\n\u003e * take special efforts to promote freedom of religion and conscience\n\u003e and defend it from encroachment by repressive governments.\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e We will champion the cause of human dignity and oppose those who resist\n\u003e it.\n\u003e\n\u003e III. Strengthen Alliances to Defeat Global Terrorism and Work to Prevent\n\u003e Attacks Against Us and Our Friends\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e \"Just three days removed from these events, Americans do not yet have\n\u003e the distance of history. But our responsibility to history is already\n\u003e clear: to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil. War has been\n\u003e waged against us by stealth and deceit and murder. This nation is\n\u003e peaceful, but fierce when stirred to anger. The conflict was begun on\n\u003e the timing and terms of others. It will end in a way, and at an hour, of\n\u003e our choosing.\"\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e President Bush\n\u003e Washington, D.C. (The National Cathedral)\n\u003e September 14, 2001\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e The United States of America is fighting a war against terrorists of\n\u003e global reach. The enemy is not a single political regime or user or\n\u003e religion or ideology. The enemy is terrorism -- premeditated,\n\u003e politically motivated violence perpetrated against innocents.\n\u003e\n\u003e In many regions, legitimate grievances prevent the emergence of a\n\u003e lasting peace. Such grievances deserve to be, and must be, addressed\n\u003e within a political process. But no cause justifies terror. The United\n\u003e States will make no concessions to terrorist demands and strike no deals\n\u003e with them. We make no distinction between terrorists and those who\n\u003e knowingly harbor or provide aid to them.\n\u003e\n\u003e The struggle against global terrorism is different from any other war in\n\u003e our history. It will be fought on many fronts against a particularly\n\u003e elusive enemy over an extended period of time. Progress will come\n\u003e through the persistent accumulation of successes -- some seen, some\n\u003e unseen.\n\u003e\n\u003e Today our enemies have seen the results of what civilized nations can,\n\u003e and will, do against regimes that harbor, support, and use terrorism to\n\u003e achieve their political goals. Afghanistan has been liberated; coalition\n\u003e forces continue to hunt down the Taliban and al-Qaida. But it is not\n\u003e only this battlefield on which we will engage terrorists. Thousands of\n\u003e trained terrorists remain at large with cells in North America, South\n\u003e America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and across Asia.\n\u003e\n\u003e Our priority will be first to disrupt and destroy terrorist\n\u003e organizations of global reach and attack their leadership; command,\n\u003e control, and communications; material support; and finances. This will\n\u003e have a disabling effect upon the terrorists\u0027 ability to plan and operate.\n\u003e\n\u003e We will continue to encourage our regional partners to take up a\n\u003e coordinated effort that isolates the terrorists. Once the regional\n\u003e campaign localizes the threat to a particular state, we will help ensure\n\u003e the state has the military, law enforcement, political, and financial\n\u003e tools necessary to finish the task.\n\u003e\n\u003e The United States will continue to work with our allies to disrupt the\n\u003e financing of terrorism. We will identify and block the sources of\n\u003e funding for terrorism, freeze the assets of terrorists and those who\n\u003e support them, deny terrorists access to the international financial\n\u003e system, protect legitimate charities from being abused by terrorists,\n\u003e and prevent the movement of terrorists\u0027 assets through alternative\n\u003e financial networks.\n\u003e\n\u003e However, this campaign need not be sequential to be effective, the\n\u003e cumulative effect across all regions will help achieve the results we\n\u003e seek.\n\u003e\n\u003e We will disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations by:\n\u003e\n\u003e * direct and continuous action using all the elements of national and\n\u003e international power. Our immediate focus will be those terrorist\n\u003e organizations of global reach and any terrorist or state sponsor of\n\u003e terrorism which attempts to gain or use weapons of mass destruction\n\u003e (WMD) or their precursors;\n\u003e\n\u003e * defending the United States, the American people, and our interests\n\u003e at home and abroad by identifying and destroying the threat before it\n\u003e reaches our borders. While the United States will constantly strive to\n\u003e enlist the support of the international community, we will not hesitate\n\u003e to act alone, if necessary, to exercise our right of self-defense by\n\u003e acting preemptively against such terrorists, to prevent them from doing\n\u003e harm against our people and our country; and\n\u003e\n\u003e * denying further sponsorship, support, and sanctuary to terrorists\n\u003e by convincing or compelling states to accept their sovereign\n\u003e responsibilities.\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e We will also wage a war of ideas to win the battle against international\n\u003e terrorism. This includes:\n\u003e\n\u003e * using the full influence of the United States, and working closely\n\u003e with allies and friends, to make clear that all acts of terrorism are\n\u003e illegitimate so that terrorism will be viewed in the same light as\n\u003e slavery, piracy, or genocide: behavior that no respectable government\n\u003e can condone or support and all must oppose;\n\u003e\n\u003e * supporting moderate and modern government, especially in the Muslim\n\u003e world, to ensure that the conditions and ideologies that promote\n\u003e terrorism do not find fertile ground in any nation;\n\u003e\n\u003e * diminishing the underlying conditions that spawn terrorism by\n\u003e enlisting the international community to focus its efforts and resources\n\u003e on areas most at risk; and\n\u003e\n\u003e * using effective public diplomacy to promote the free flow of\n\u003e information and ideas to kindle the hopes and aspirations of freedom of\n\u003e those in societies ruled by the sponsors of global terrorism.\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e While we recognize that our best defense is a good offense we are also\n\u003e strengthening America\u0027s homeland security to protect against and deter\n\u003e attack.\n\u003e\n\u003e This Administration has proposed the largest government reorganization\n\u003e since the Truman Administration created the National Security Council\n\u003e and the Department of Defense. Centered on a new Department of Homeland\n\u003e Security and including a new unified military command and a fundamental\n\u003e reordering of the FBI, our comprehensive plan to secure the homeland\n\u003e encompasses every level of government and the cooperation of the public\n\u003e and the private sector.\n\u003e\n\u003e This strategy will turn adversity into opportunity. For example,\n\u003e emergency management systems will be better able to cope not just with\n\u003e terrorism but with all hazards. Our medical system will be strengthened\n\u003e to manage not just bioterror, but all infectious diseases and\n\u003e mass-casualty dangers. Our border controls will not just stop\n\u003e terrorists, but improve the efficient movement of legitimate traffic.\n\u003e\n\u003e While our focus is protecting America, we know that to defeat terrorism\n\u003e in today\u0027s globalized world we need support from our allies and friends.\n\u003e Wherever possible, the United States will rely on regional organizations\n\u003e and state powers to meet their obligations to fight terrorism. Where\n\u003e governments find the fight against terrorism beyond their capacities, we\n\u003e will match their willpower and their resources with whatever help we and\n\u003e our allies can provide.\n\u003e\n\u003e As we pursue the terrorists in Afghanistan, we will continue to work\n\u003e with international organizations such as the United Nations, as well as\n\u003e non-governmental organizations, and other countries to provide the\n\u003e humanitarian, political, economic, and security assistance necessary to\n\u003e rebuild Afghanistan so that it will never again abuse its people,\n\u003e threaten its neighbors, and provide a haven for terrorists\n\u003e\n\u003e In the war against global terrorism, we will never forget that we are\n\u003e ultimately fighting for our democratic values and way of life. Freedom\n\u003e and fear are at war, and there will be no quick or easy end to this\n\u003e conflict. In leading the campaign against terrorism, we are forging new,\n\u003e productive international relationships and redefining existing ones in\n\u003e ways that meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.\n\u003e\n\u003e IV. Work with Others To Defuse Regional Conflicts\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e \"We build a world of justice, or we will live in a world of coercion.\n\u003e The magnitude of our shared responsibilities makes our disagreements\n\u003e look so small.\"\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e President Bush\n\u003e Berlin, Germany\n\u003e May 23, 2002\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e Concerned nations must remain actively engaged in critical regional\n\u003e disputes to avoid explosive escalation and minimize human suffering. In\n\u003e an increasingly interconnected world, regional crisis can strain our\n\u003e alliances, rekindle rivalries among the major powers, and create\n\u003e horrifying affronts to human dignity. When violence erupts and states\n\u003e falter, the United States will work with friends and partners to\n\u003e alleviate suffering and restore stability.\n\u003e\n\u003e No doctrine can anticipate every circumstance in which U.S. action --\n\u003e direct or indirect -- is warranted. We have finite political, economic,\n\u003e and military resources to meet our global priorities. The United States\n\u003e will approach each case with these strategic principles in mind:\n\u003e\n\u003e * The United States should invest time and resources into building\n\u003e international relationships and institutions that can help manage local\n\u003e crises when they emerge.\n\u003e\n\u003e * The United States should be realistic about its ability to help\n\u003e those who are unwilling or unready to help themselves. Where and when\n\u003e people are ready to do their part, we will be willing to move decisively.\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e Policies in several key regions offer some illustrations of how we will\n\u003e apply these principles:\n\u003e\n\u003e The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is critical because of the toll of\n\u003e human suffering, because of America\u0027s close relationship with the state\n\u003e of Israel and key Arab states, and because of that region\u0027s importance\n\u003e to other global priorities of the United States. There can be no peace\n\u003e for either side without freedom for both sides. America stands committed\n\u003e to an independent and democratic Palestine, living beside Israel in\n\u003e peace and security. Like all other people, Palestinians deserve a\n\u003e government that serves their interests, and listens to their voices, and\n\u003e counts their votes. The United States will continue to encourage all\n\u003e parties to step up to their responsibilities as we seek a just and\n\u003e comprehensive settlement to the conflict.\n\u003e\n\u003e The United States, the international donor community, and the World Bank\n\u003e stand ready to work with a reformed Palestinian government on economic\n\u003e development, increased humanitarian assistance and a program to\n\u003e establish, finance, and monitor a truly independent judiciary. If\n\u003e Palestinians embrace democracy, and the rule of law, confront\n\u003e corruption, and firmly reject terror, they can count on American support\n\u003e for the creation of a Palestinian state.\n\u003e\n\u003e Israel also has a large stake in the success of a democratic Palestine.\n\u003e Permanent occupation threatens Israel\u0027s identity and democracy. So the\n\u003e United States continues to challenge Israeli leaders to take concrete\n\u003e steps to support the emergence of a viable, credible Palestinian state.\n\u003e As there is progress towards security, Israel forces need to withdraw\n\u003e fully to positions they held prior to September 28, 2000. And consistent\n\u003e with the recommendations of the Mitchell Committee, Israeli settlement\n\u003e activity in the occupied territories must stop. As violence subsides,\n\u003e freedom of movement should be restored, permitting innocent Palestinians\n\u003e to resume work and normal life. The United States can play a crucial\n\u003e role but, ultimately, lasting peace can only come when Israelis and\n\u003e Palestinians resolve the issues and end the conflict between them.\n\u003e\n\u003e In South Asia, the United States has also emphasized the need for India\n\u003e and Pakistan to resolve their disputes. This administration invested\n\u003e time and resources building strong bilateral relations with India and\n\u003e Pakistan. These strong relations then gave us leverage to play a\n\u003e constructive role when tensions in the region became acute. With\n\u003e Pakistan, our bilateral relations have been bolstered by Pakistan\u0027s\n\u003e choice to join the war against terror and move toward building a more\n\u003e open and tolerant society. The Administration sees India\u0027s potential to\n\u003e become one of the great democratic powers of the twenty-first century\n\u003e and has worked hard to transform our relationship accordingly. Our\n\u003e involvement in this regional dispute, building on earlier investments in\n\u003e bilateral relations, looks first to concrete steps by India and Pakistan\n\u003e that can help defuse military confrontation.\n\u003e\n\u003e Indonesia took courageous steps to create a working democracy and\n\u003e respect for the rule of law. By tolerating ethnic minorities, respecting\n\u003e the rule of law, and accepting open markets, Indonesia may be able to\n\u003e employ the engine of opportunity that has helped lift some of its\n\u003e neighbors out of poverty and desperation. It is the initiative by\n\u003e Indonesia that allows U.S. assistance to make a difference.\n\u003e\n\u003e In the Western Hemisphere we have formed flexible coalitions with\n\u003e countries that share our priorities, particularly Mexico, Brazil,\n\u003e Canada, Chile, and Colombia. Together we will promote a truly democratic\n\u003e hemisphere where our integration advances security, prosperity,\n\u003e opportunity, and hope. We will work with regional institutions, such as\n\u003e the Summit of the Americas process, the Organization of American States\n\u003e (OAS), and the Defense Ministerial of the Americas for the benefit of\n\u003e the entire hemisphere.\n\u003e\n\u003e Parts of Latin America confront regional conflict, especially arising\n\u003e from the violence of drug cartels and their accomplices. This conflict\n\u003e and unrestrained narcotics trafficking could imperil the health and\n\u003e security of the United States. Therefore we have developed an active\n\u003e strategy to help the Andean nations adjust their economies, enforce\n\u003e their laws, defeat terrorist organizations, and cut off the supply of\n\u003e drugs, while -- as important -- we work to reduce the demand for drugs\n\u003e in our own country.\n\u003e\n\u003e In Colombia, we recognize the link between terrorist and extremist\n\u003e groups that challenge the security of the state and drug trafficking\n\u003e activities that help finance the operations of such groups. We are\n\u003e working to help Colombia defend its democratic institutions and defeat\n\u003e illegal armed groups of both the left and right by extending effective\n\u003e sovereignty over the entire national territory and provide basic\n\u003e security to the Colombian people.\n\u003e\n\u003e In Africa, promise and opportunity sit side by side with disease, war,\n\u003e and desperate poverty. This threatens both a core value of the United\n\u003e States -- preserving human dignity -- and our strategic priority --\n\u003e combating global terror. American interests and American principles,\n\u003e therefore, lead in the same direction: we will work with others for an\n\u003e African continent that lives in liberty, peace, and growing prosperity.\n\u003e Together with our European allies, we must help strengthen Africa\u0027s\n\u003e fragile states, help build indigenous capability to secure porous\n\u003e borders, and help build up the law enforcement and intelligence\n\u003e infrastructure to deny havens for terrorists.\n\u003e\n\u003e An ever more lethal environment exists in Africa as local civil wars\n\u003e spread beyond borders to create regional war zones. Forming coalitions\n\u003e of the willing and cooperative security arrangements are key to\n\u003e confronting these emerging transnational threats.\n\u003e\n\u003e Africa\u0027s great size and diversity requires a security strategy that\n\u003e focuses bilateral engagement, and builds coalitions of the willing. This\n\u003e administration will focus on three interlocking strategies for the\n\u003e region:\n\u003e\n\u003e * countries with major impact on their neighborhood such as South\n\u003e Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, and Ethiopia are anchors for regional engagement\n\u003e and require focused attention;\n\u003e\n\u003e * coordination with European allies and international institutions is\n\u003e essential for constructive conflict mediation and successful peace\n\u003e operations; and\n\u003e\n\u003e * Africa\u0027s capable reforming states and sub-regional organizations\n\u003e must be strengthened as the primary means to address transnational\n\u003e threats on a sustained basis.\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e Ultimately the path of political and economic freedom presents the\n\u003e surest route to progress in sub-Saharan Africa, where most wars are\n\u003e conflicts over material resources and political access often tragically\n\u003e waged on the basis of ethnic and religious difference. The transition to\n\u003e the African Union with its stated commitment to good governance and a\n\u003e common responsibility for democratic political systems offers\n\u003e opportunities to strengthen democracy on the continent.\n\u003e\n\u003e V. Prevent Our Enemies from Threatening Us, Our Allies, and Our Friends\n\u003e with Weapons of Mass Destruction\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e \"The gravest danger to freedom lies at the crossroads of radicalism and\n\u003e technology. When the spread of chemical and biological and nuclear\n\u003e weapons, along with ballistic missile technology -- when that occurs,\n\u003e even weak states and small groups could attain a catastrophic power to\n\u003e strike great nations. Our enemies have declared this very intention, and\n\u003e have been caught seeking these terrible weapons. They want the\n\u003e capability to blackmail us, or to harm us, or to harm our friends -- and\n\u003e we will oppose them with all our power.\"\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e President Bush\n\u003e West Point, New York\n\u003e June 1, 2002\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e The nature of the Cold War threat required the United States -- with our\n\u003e allies and friends -- to emphasize deterrence of the enemy\u0027s use of\n\u003e force, producing a grim strategy of mutual assured destruction. With the\n\u003e collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, our security\n\u003e environment has undergone profound transformation.\n\u003e\n\u003e Having moved from confrontation to cooperation as the hallmark of our\n\u003e relationship with Russia, the dividends are evident: an end to the\n\u003e balance of terror that divided us; an historic reduction in the nuclear\n\u003e arsenals on both sides; and cooperation in areas such as\n\u003e counterterrorism and missile defense that until recently were\n\u003e inconceivable.\n\u003e\n\u003e But new deadly challenges have emerged from rogue states and terrorists.\n\u003e None of these contemporary threats rival the sheer destructive power\n\u003e that was arrayed against us by the Soviet Union. However, the nature and\n\u003e motivations of these new adversaries, their determination to obtain\n\u003e destructive powers hitherto available only to the world\u0027s strongest\n\u003e states, and the greater likelihood that they will use weapons of mass\n\u003e destruction against us, make today\u0027s security environment more complex\n\u003e and dangerous.\n\u003e\n\u003e In the 1990s we witnessed the emergence of a small number of rogue\n\u003e states that, while different in important ways, share a number of\n\u003e attributes. These states:\n\u003e\n\u003e * brutalize their own people and squander their national resources\n\u003e for the personal gain of the rulers;\n\u003e\n\u003e * display no regard for international law, threaten their neighbors,\n\u003e and callously violate international treaties to which they are party;\n\u003e\n\u003e * are determined to acquire weapons of mass destruction, along with\n\u003e other advanced military technology, to be used as threats or offensively\n\u003e to achieve the aggressive designs of these regimes;\n\u003e\n\u003e * sponsor terrorism around the globe; and\n\u003e\n\u003e * reject basic human values and hate the United States and everything\n\u003e for which it stands.\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e At the time of the Gulf War, we acquired irrefutable proof that Iraq\u0027s\n\u003e designs were not limited to the chemical weapons it had used against\n\u003e Iran and its own people, but also extended to the acquisition of nuclear\n\u003e weapons and biological agents. In the past decade North Korea has become\n\u003e the world\u0027s principal purveyor of ballistic missiles, and has tested\n\u003e increasingly capable missiles while developing its own WMD arsenal.\n\u003e Other rogue regimes seek nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons as\n\u003e well. These states\u0027 pursuit of, and global trade in, such weapons has\n\u003e become a looming threat to all nations.\n\u003e\n\u003e We must be prepared to stop rogue states and their terrorist clients\n\u003e before they are able to threaten or use weapons of mass destruction\n\u003e against the United States and our allies and friends. Our response must\n\u003e take full advantage of strengthened alliances, the establishment of new\n\u003e partnerships with former adversaries, innovation in the use of military\n\u003e forces, modern technologies, including the development of an effective\n\u003e missile defense system, and increased emphasis on intelligence\n\u003e collection and analysis.\n\u003e\n\u003e Our comprehensive strategy to combat WMD includes:\n\u003e\n\u003e * Proactive counterproliferation efforts. We must deter and defend\n\u003e against the threat before it is unleashed. We must ensure that key\n\u003e capabilities -- detection, active and passive defenses, and counterforce\n\u003e capabilities -- are integrated into our defense transformation and our\n\u003e homeland security systems. Counterproliferation must also be integrated\n\u003e into the doctrine, training, and equipping of our forces and those of\n\u003e our allies to ensure that we can prevail in any conflict with WMD-armed\n\u003e adversaries.\n\u003e\n\u003e * Strengthened nonproliferation efforts to prevent rogue states and\n\u003e terrorists from acquiring the materials, technologies and expertise\n\u003e necessary for weapons of mass destruction. We will enhance diplomacy,\n\u003e arms control, multilateral export controls, and threat reduction\n\u003e assistance that impede states and terrorists seeking WMD, and when\n\u003e necessary, interdict enabling technologies and materials. We will\n\u003e continue to build coalitions to support these efforts, encouraging their\n\u003e increased political and financial support for nonproliferation and\n\u003e threat reduction programs. The recent G-8 agreement to commit up to $20\n\u003e billion to a global partnership against proliferation marks a major step\n\u003e forward.\n\u003e\n\u003e * Effective consequence management to respond to the effects of WMD\n\u003e use, whether by terrorists or hostile states. Minimizing the effects of\n\u003e WMD use against our people will help deter those who possess such\n\u003e weapons and dissuade those who seek to acquire them by persuading\n\u003e enemies that they cannot attain their desired ends. The United States\n\u003e must also be prepared to respond to the effects of WMD use against our\n\u003e forces abroad, and to help friends and allies if they are attacked.\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e It has taken almost a decade for us to comprehend the true nature of\n\u003e this new threat. Given the goals of rogue states and terrorists, the\n\u003e United States can no longer solely rely on a reactive posture as we have\n\u003e in the past. The inability to deter a potential attacker, the immediacy\n\u003e of today\u0027s threats, and the magnitude of potential harm that could be\n\u003e caused by our adversaries\u0027 choice of weapons, do not permit that option.\n\u003e We cannot let our enemies strike first.\n\u003e\n\u003e * In the Cold War, especially following the Cuban missile crisis, we\n\u003e faced a generally status quo, risk-averse adversary. Deterrence was an\n\u003e effective defense. But deterrence based only upon the threat of\n\u003e retaliation is far less likely to work against leaders of rogue states\n\u003e more willing to take risks, gambling with the lives of their people, and\n\u003e the wealth of their nations.\n\u003e\n\u003e * In the Cold War, weapons of mass destruction were considered\n\u003e weapons of last resort whose use risked the destruction of those who\n\u003e used them. Today, our enemies see weapons of mass destruction as weapons\n\u003e of choice. For rogue states these weapons are tools of intimidation and\n\u003e military aggression against their neighbors. These weapons may also\n\u003e allow these states to attempt to blackmail the United States and our\n\u003e allies to prevent us from deterring or repelling the aggressive behavior\n\u003e of rogue states. Such states also see these weapons as their best means\n\u003e of overcoming the conventional superiority of the United States.\n\u003e\n\u003e * Traditional concepts of deterrence will not work against a\n\u003e terrorist enemy whose avowed tactics are wanton destruction and the\n\u003e targeting of innocents; whose so-called soldiers seek martyrdom in death\n\u003e and whose most potent protection is statelessness. The overlap between\n\u003e states that sponsor terror and those that pursue WMD compels us to\n\u003e action.\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e For centuries, international law recognized that nations need not suffer\n\u003e an attack before they can lawfully take action to defend themselves\n\u003e against forces that present an imminent danger of attack. Legal scholars\n\u003e and international jurists often conditioned the legitimacy of preemption\n\u003e on the existence of an imminent threat -- most often a visible\n\u003e mobilization of armies, navies, and air forces preparing to attack.\n\u003e\n\u003e We must adapt the concept of imminent threat to the capabilities and\n\u003e objectives of today\u0027s adversaries. Rogue states and terrorists do not\n\u003e seek to attack us using conventional means. They know such attacks would\n\u003e fail. Instead, they rely on acts of terrorism and, potentially, the use\n\u003e of weapons of mass destruction -- weapons that can be easily concealed\n\u003e and delivered covertly and without warning.\n\u003e\n\u003e The targets of these attacks are our military forces and our civilian\n\u003e population, in direct violation of one of the principal norms of the law\n\u003e of warfare. As was demonstrated by the losses on September 11, 2001,\n\u003e mass civilian casualties is the specific objective of terrorists and\n\u003e these losses would be exponentially more severe if terrorists acquired\n\u003e and used weapons of mass destruction.\n\u003e\n\u003e The United States has long maintained the option of preemptive actions\n\u003e to counter a sufficient threat to our national security. The greater the\n\u003e threat, the greater is the risk of inaction -- and the more compelling\n\u003e the case for taking anticipatory action to defend ourselves, even if\n\u003e uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemy\u0027s attack. To\n\u003e forestall or prevent such hostile acts by our adversaries, the United\n\u003e States will, if necessary, act preemptively.\n\u003e\n\u003e The United States will not use force in all cases to preempt emerging\n\u003e threats, nor should nations use preemption as a pretext for aggression.\n\u003e Yet in an age where the enemies of civilization openly and actively seek\n\u003e the world\u0027s most destructive technologies, the United States cannot\n\u003e remain idle while dangers gather.\n\u003e\n\u003e We will always proceed deliberately, weighing the consequences of our\n\u003e actions. To support preemptive options, we will:\n\u003e\n\u003e * build better, more integrated intelligence capabilities to provide\n\u003e timely, accurate information on threats, wherever they may emerge;\n\u003e\n\u003e * coordinate closely with allies to form a common assessment of the\n\u003e most dangerous threats; and\n\u003e\n\u003e * continue to transform our military forces to ensure our ability to\n\u003e conduct rapid and precise operations to achieve decisive results.\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e The purpose of our actions will always be to eliminate a specific threat\n\u003e to the United States or our allies and friends. The reasons for our\n\u003e actions will be clear, the force measured, and the cause just.\n\u003e\n\u003e VI. Ignite a New Era of Global Economic Growth through Free Markets and\n\u003e Free Trade.\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e \"When nations close their markets and opportunity is hoarded by a\n\u003e privileged few, no amount -- no amount -- of development aid is ever\n\u003e enough. When nations respect their people, open markets, invest in\n\u003e better health and education, every dollar of aid, every dollar of trade\n\u003e revenue and domestic capital is used more effectively.\"\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e President Bush\n\u003e Monterrey, Mexico\n\u003e March 22, 2002\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e A strong world economy enhances our national security by advancing\n\u003e prosperity and freedom in the rest of the world. Economic growth\n\u003e supported by free trade and free markets creates new jobs and higher\n\u003e incomes. It allows people to lift their lives out of poverty, spurs\n\u003e economic and legal reform, and the fight against corruption, and it\n\u003e reinforces the habits of liberty.\n\u003e\n\u003e We will promote economic growth and economic freedom beyond America\u0027s\n\u003e shores. All governments are responsible for creating their own economic\n\u003e policies and responding to their own economic challenge. We will use our\n\u003e economic engagement with other countries to underscore the benefits of\n\u003e policies that generate higher productivity and sustained economic\n\u003e growth, including:\n\u003e\n\u003e * pro-growth legal and regulatory policies to encourage business\n\u003e investment, innovation, and entrepreneurial activity;\n\u003e\n\u003e * tax policies -- particularly lower marginal tax rates -- that\n\u003e improve incentives for work and investment;\n\u003e\n\u003e * rule of law and intolerance of corruption so that people are\n\u003e confident that they will be able to enjoy the fruits of their economic\n\u003e endeavors;\n\u003e\n\u003e * strong financial systems that allow capital to be put to its most\n\u003e efficient use;\n\u003e\n\u003e * sound fiscal policies to support business activity;\n\u003e\n\u003e * investments in health and education that improve the well-being and\n\u003e skills of the labor force and population as a whole; and\n\u003e\n\u003e * free trade that provides new avenues for growth and fosters the\n\u003e diffusion of technologies and ideas that increase productivity and\n\u003e opportunity.\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e The lessons of history are clear: market economies, not\n\u003e command-and-control economies with the heavy hand of government, are the\n\u003e best way to promote prosperity and reduce poverty. Policies that further\n\u003e strengthen market incentives and market institutions are relevant for\n\u003e all economies -- industrialized countries, emerging markets, and the\n\u003e developing world.\n\u003e\n\u003e A return to strong economic growth in Europe and Japan is vital to U.S.\n\u003e national security interests. We want our allies to have strong economies\n\u003e for their own sake, for the sake of the global economy, and for the sake\n\u003e of global security. European efforts to remove structural barriers in\n\u003e their economies are particularly important in this regard, as are\n\u003e Japan\u0027s efforts to end deflation and address the problems of\n\u003e non-performing loans in the Japanese banking system. We will continue to\n\u003e use our regular consultations with Japan and our European partners --\n\u003e including through the Group of Seven (G-7) -- to discuss policies they\n\u003e are adopting to promote growth in their economies and support higher\n\u003e global economic growth.\n\u003e\n\u003e Improving stability in emerging markets is also key to global economic\n\u003e growth. International flows of investment capital are needed to expand\n\u003e the productive potential of these economies. These flows allow emerging\n\u003e markets and developing countries to make the investments that raise\n\u003e living standards and reduce poverty. Our long-term objective should be a\n\u003e world in which all countries have investment-grade credit ratings that\n\u003e allow them access to international capital markets and to invest in\n\u003e their future.\n\u003e\n\u003e We are committed to policies that will help emerging markets achieve\n\u003e access to larger capital flows at lower cost. To this end, we will\n\u003e continue to pursue reforms aimed at reducing uncertainty in financial\n\u003e markets. We will work actively with other countries, the International\n\u003e Monetary Fund (IMF), and the private sector to implement the G-7 Action\n\u003e Plan negotiated earlier this year for preventing financial crises and\n\u003e more effectively resolving them when they occur.\n\u003e\n\u003e The best way to deal with financial crises is to prevent them from\n\u003e occurring, and we have encouraged the IMF to improve its efforts doing\n\u003e so. We will continue to work with the IMF to streamline the policy\n\u003e conditions for its lending and to focus its lending strategy on\n\u003e achieving economic growth through sound fiscal and monetary policy,\n\u003e exchange rate policy, and financial sector policy.\n\u003e\n\u003e The concept of \"free trade\" arose as a moral principle even before it\n\u003e became a pillar of economics. If you can make something that others\n\u003e value, you should be able to sell it to them. If others make something\n\u003e that you value, you should be able to buy it. This is real freedom, the\n\u003e freedom for a user -- or a nation -- to make a living. To promote free\n\u003e trade, the Unites States has developed a comprehensive strategy:\n\u003e\n\u003e * Seize the global initiative. The new global trade negotiations we\n\u003e helped launch at Doha in November 2001 will have an ambitious agenda,\n\u003e especially in agriculture, manufacturing, and services, targeted for\n\u003e completion in 2005. The United States has led the way in completing the\n\u003e accession of China and a democratic Taiwan to the World Trade\n\u003e Organization. We will assist Russia\u0027s preparations to join the WTO.\n\u003e\n\u003e * Press regional initiatives. The United States and other democracies\n\u003e in the Western Hemisphere have agreed to create the Free Trade Area of\n\u003e the Americas, targeted for completion in 2005. This year the United\n\u003e States will advocate market-access negotiations with its partners,\n\u003e targeted on agriculture, industrial goods, services, investment, and\n\u003e government procurement. We will also offer more opportunity to the\n\u003e poorest continent, Africa, starting with full use of the preferences\n\u003e allowed in the African Growth and Opportunity Act, and leading to free\n\u003e trade.\n\u003e\n\u003e * Move ahead with bilateral free trade agreements. Building on the\n\u003e free trade agreement with Jordan enacted in 2001, the Administration\n\u003e will work this year to complete free trade agreements with Chile and\n\u003e Singapore. Our aim is to achieve free trade agreements with a mix of\n\u003e developed and developing countries in all regions of the world.\n\u003e Initially, Central America, Southern Africa, Morocco, and Australia will\n\u003e be our principal focal points.\n\u003e\n\u003e * Renew the executive-congressional partnership. Every\n\u003e administration\u0027s trade strategy depends on a productive partnership with\n\u003e Congress. After a gap of 8 years, the Administration reestablished\n\u003e majority support in the Congress for trade liberalization by passing\n\u003e Trade Promotion Authority and the other market opening measures for\n\u003e developing countries in the Trade Act of 2002. This Administration will\n\u003e work with Congress to enact new bilateral, regional, and global trade\n\u003e agreements that will be concluded under the recently passed Trade\n\u003e Promotion Authority.\n\u003e\n\u003e * Promote the connection between trade and development. Trade\n\u003e policies can help developing countries strengthen property rights,\n\u003e competition, the rule of law, investment, the spread of knowledge, open\n\u003e societies, the efficient allocation of resources, and regional\n\u003e integration -- all leading to growth, opportunity, and confidence in\n\u003e developing countries. The United States is implementing The Africa\n\u003e Growth and Opportunity Act to provide market-access for nearly all goods\n\u003e produced in the 35 countries of sub-Saharan Africa. We will make more\n\u003e use of this act and its equivalent for the Caribbean Basin and continue\n\u003e to work with multilateral and regional institutions to help poorer\n\u003e countries take advantage of these opportunities. Beyond market access,\n\u003e the most important area where trade intersects with poverty is in public\n\u003e health. We will ensure that the WTO intellectual property rules are\n\u003e flexible enough to allow developing nations to gain access to critical\n\u003e medicines for extraordinary dangers like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and\n\u003e malaria.\n\u003e\n\u003e * Enforce trade agreements and laws against unfair practices.\n\u003e Commerce depends on the rule of law; international trade depends on\n\u003e enforceable agreements. Our top priorities are to resolve ongoing\n\u003e disputes with the European Union, Canada, and Mexico and to make a\n\u003e global effort to address new technology, science, and health regulations\n\u003e that needlessly impede farm exports and improved agriculture. Laws\n\u003e against unfair trade practices are often abused, but the international\n\u003e community must be able to address genuine concerns about government\n\u003e subsidies and dumping. International industrial espionage which\n\u003e undermines fair competition must be detected and deterred.\n\u003e\n\u003e * Help domestic industries and workers adjust. There is a sound\n\u003e statutory framework for these transitional safeguards which we have used\n\u003e in the agricultural sector and which we are using this year to help the\n\u003e American steel industry. The benefits of free trade depend upon the\n\u003e enforcement of fair trading practices. These safeguards help ensure that\n\u003e the benefits of free trade do not come at the expense of American\n\u003e workers. Trade adjustment assistance will help workers adapt to the\n\u003e change and dynamism of open markets.\n\u003e\n\u003e * Protect the environment and workers. The United States must foster\n\u003e economic growth in ways that will provide a better life along with\n\u003e widening prosperity. We will incorporate labor and environmental\n\u003e concerns into U.S. trade negotiations, creating a healthy \"network\"\n\u003e between multilateral environmental agreements with the WTO, and use the\n\u003e International Labor Organization, trade preference programs, and trade\n\u003e talks to improve working conditions in conjunction with freer trade.\n\u003e\n\u003e * Enhance energy security. We will strengthen our own energy security\n\u003e and the shared prosperity of the global economy by working with our\n\u003e allies, trading partners, and energy producers to expand the sources and\n\u003e types of global energy supplied, especially in the Western Hemisphere,\n\u003e Africa, Central Asia, and the Caspian region. We will also continue to\n\u003e work with our partners to develop cleaner and more energy efficient\n\u003e technologies.\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e Economic growth should be accompanied by global efforts to stabilize\n\u003e greenhouse gas concentrations associated with this growth, containing\n\u003e them at a level that prevents dangerous human interference with the\n\u003e global climate. Our overall objective is to reduce America\u0027s greenhouse\n\u003e gas emissions relative to the size of our economy, cutting such\n\u003e emissions per unit of economic activity by 18 percent over the next 10\n\u003e years, by the year 2012. Our strategies for attaining this goal will be\n\u003e to:\n\u003e\n\u003e * remain committed to the basic U.N. Framework Convention for\n\u003e international cooperation;\n\u003e\n\u003e * obtain agreements with key industries to cut emissions of some of\n\u003e the most potent greenhouse gases and give transferable credits to\n\u003e companies that can show real cuts;\n\u003e\n\u003e * develop improved standards for measuring and registering emission\n\u003e reductions;\n\u003e\n\u003e * promote renewable energy production and clean coal technology, as\n\u003e well as nuclear power -- which produces no greenhouse gas emissions,\n\u003e while also improving fuel economy for U.S. cars and trucks;\n\u003e\n\u003e * increase spending on research and new conservation technologies, to\n\u003e a total of $4.5 billion -- the largest sum being spent on climate change\n\u003e by any country in the world and a $700 million increase over last year\u0027s\n\u003e budget; and\n\u003e\n\u003e * assist developing countries, especially the major greenhouse gas\n\u003e emitters such as China and India, so that they will have the tools and\n\u003e resources to join this effort and be able to grow along a cleaner and\n\u003e better path.\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e VII. Expand the Circle of Development by Opening Societies and Building\n\u003e the Infrastructure of Democracy\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e \"In World War II we fought to make the world safer, then worked to\n\u003e rebuild it. As we wage war today to keep the world safe from terror, we\n\u003e must also work to make the world a better place for all its citizens.\"\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e President Bush\n\u003e Washington, D.C. (Inter-American\n\u003e Development Bank)\n\u003e March 14, 2002\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e A world where some live in comfort and plenty, while half of the human\n\u003e race lives on less than $2 a day, is neither just nor stable. Including\n\u003e all of the world\u0027s poor in an expanding circle of development -- and\n\u003e opportunity -- is a moral imperative and one of the top priorities of\n\u003e U.S. international policy.\n\u003e\n\u003e Decades of massive development assistance have failed to spur economic\n\u003e growth in the poorest countries. Worse, development aid has often served\n\u003e to prop up failed policies, relieving the pressure for reform and\n\u003e perpetuating misery. Results of aid are typically measured in dollars\n\u003e spent by donors, not in the rates of growth and poverty reduction\n\u003e achieved by recipients. These are the indicators of a failed strategy.\n\u003e\n\u003e Working with other nations, the United States is confronting this\n\u003e failure. We forged a new consensus at the U.N. Conference on Financing\n\u003e for Development in Monterrey that the objectives of assistance -- and\n\u003e the strategies to achieve those objectives -- must change.\n\u003e\n\u003e This Administration\u0027s goal is to help unleash the productive potential\n\u003e of individuals in all nations. Sustained growth and poverty reduction is\n\u003e impossible without the right national policies. Where governments have\n\u003e implemented real policy changes we will provide significant new levels\n\u003e of assistance. The United States and other developed countries should\n\u003e set an ambitious and specific target: to double the size of the world\u0027s\n\u003e poorest economies within a decade.\n\u003e\n\u003e The United States Government will pursue these major strategies to\n\u003e achieve this goal:\n\u003e\n\u003e * Provide resources to aid countries that have met the challenge of\n\u003e national reform. We propose a 50 percent increase in the core\n\u003e development assistance given by the United States. While continuing our\n\u003e present programs, including humanitarian assistance based on need alone,\n\u003e these billions of new dollars will form a new Millennium Challenge\n\u003e Account for projects in countries whose governments rule justly, invest\n\u003e in their people, and encourage economic freedom. Governments must fight\n\u003e corruption, respect basic human rights, embrace the rule of law, invest\n\u003e in health care and education, follow responsible economic policies, and\n\u003e enable entrepreneurship. The Millennium Challenge Account will reward\n\u003e countries that have demonstrated real policy change and challenge those\n\u003e that have not to implement reforms.\n\u003e\n\u003e * Improve the effectiveness of the World Bank and other development\n\u003e banks in raising living standards. The United States is committed to a\n\u003e comprehensive reform agenda for making the World Bank and the other\n\u003e multilateral development banks more effective in improving the lives of\n\u003e the world\u0027s poor. We have reversed the downward trend in U.S.\n\u003e contributions and proposed an 18 percent increase in the U.S.\n\u003e contributions to the International Development Association (IDA) -- the\n\u003e World Bank\u0027s fund for the poorest countries -- and the African\n\u003e Development Fund. The key to raising living standards and reducing\n\u003e poverty around the world is increasing productivity growth, especially\n\u003e in the poorest countries. We will continue to press the multilateral\n\u003e development banks to focus on activities that increase economic\n\u003e productivity, such as improvements in education, health, rule of law,\n\u003e and private sector development. Every project, every loan, every grant\n\u003e must be judged by how much it will increase productivity growth in\n\u003e developing countries.\n\u003e\n\u003e * Insist upon measurable results to ensure that development\n\u003e assistance is actually making a difference in the lives of the world\u0027s\n\u003e poor. When it comes to economic development, what really matters is that\n\u003e more children are getting a better education, more people have access to\n\u003e health care and clean water, or more workers can find jobs to make a\n\u003e better future for their families. We have a moral obligation to measure\n\u003e the success of our development assistance by whether it is delivering\n\u003e results. For this reason, we will continue to demand that our own\n\u003e development assistance as well as assistance from the multilateral\n\u003e development banks has measurable goals and concrete benchmarks for\n\u003e achieving those goals. Thanks to U.S. leadership, the recent IDA\n\u003e replenishment agreement will establish a monitoring and evaluation\n\u003e system that measures recipient countries\u0027 progress. For the first time,\n\u003e donors can link a portion of their contributions to IDA to the\n\u003e achievement of actual development results, and part of the U.S.\n\u003e contribution is linked in this way. We will strive to make sure that the\n\u003e World Bank and other multilateral development banks build on this\n\u003e progress so that a focus on results is an integral part of everything\n\u003e that these institutions do.\n\u003e\n\u003e * Increase the amount of development assistance that is provided in\n\u003e the form of grants instead of loans. Greater use of results-based grants\n\u003e is the best way to help poor countries make productive investments,\n\u003e particularly in the social sectors, without saddling them with\n\u003e ever-larger debt burdens. As a result of U.S. leadership, the recent IDA\n\u003e agreement provided for significant increases in grant funding for the\n\u003e poorest countries for education, HIV/AIDS, health, nutrition, water,\n\u003e sanitation, and other human needs. Our goal is to build on that progress\n\u003e by increasing the use of grants at the other multilateral development\n\u003e banks. We will also challenge universities, nonprofits, and the private\n\u003e sector to match government efforts by using grants to support\n\u003e development projects that show results.\n\u003e\n\u003e * Open societies to commerce and investment. Trade and investment are\n\u003e the real engines of economic growth. Even if government aid increases,\n\u003e most money for development must come from trade, domestic capital, and\n\u003e foreign investment. An effective strategy must try to expand these flows\n\u003e as well. Free markets and free trade are key priorities of our national\n\u003e security strategy.\n\u003e\n\u003e * Secure public health. The scale of the public health crisis in poor\n\u003e countries is enormous. In countries afflicted by epidemics and pandemics\n\u003e like HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, growth and development will be\n\u003e threatened until these scourges can be contained. Resources from the\n\u003e developed world are necessary but will be effective only with honest\n\u003e governance, which supports prevention programs and provides effective\n\u003e local infrastructure. The United States has strongly backed the new\n\u003e global fund for HIV/AIDS organized by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan\n\u003e and its focus on combining prevention with a broad strategy for\n\u003e treatment and care. The United States already contributes more than\n\u003e twice as much money to such efforts as the next largest donor. If the\n\u003e global fund demonstrates its promise, we will be ready to give even more.\n\u003e\n\u003e * Emphasize education. Literacy and learning are the foundation of\n\u003e democracy and development. Only about 7 percent of World Bank resources\n\u003e are devoted to education. This proportion should grow. The United States\n\u003e will increase its own funding for education assistance by at least 20\n\u003e percent with an emphasis on improving basic education and teacher\n\u003e training in Africa. The United States can also bring information\n\u003e technology to these societies, many of whose education systems have been\n\u003e devastated by AIDS.\n\u003e\n\u003e * Continue to aid agricultural development. New technologies,\n\u003e including biotechnology, have enormous potential to improve crop yields\n\u003e in developing countries while using fewer pesticides and less water.\n\u003e Using sound science, the United States should help bring these benefits\n\u003e to the 800 million people, including 300 million children, who still\n\u003e suffer from hunger and malnutrition.\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e VIII. Develop Agendas for Cooperative Action with the Other Main Centers\n\u003e of Global Power\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e \"We have our best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the 17th\n\u003e century to build a world where the great powers compete in peace instead\n\u003e of prepare for war.\"\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e President Bush\n\u003e West Point, New York\n\u003e June 1, 2002\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e America will implement its strategies by organizing coalitions -- as\n\u003e broad as practicable -- of states able and willing to promote a balance\n\u003e of power that favors freedom. Effective coalition leadership requires\n\u003e clear priorities, an appreciation of others\u0027 interests, and consistent\n\u003e consultations among partners with a spirit of humility.\n\u003e\n\u003e There is little of lasting consequence that the United States can\n\u003e accomplish in the world without the sustained cooperation of its allies\n\u003e and friends in Canada and Europe. Europe is also the seat of two of the\n\u003e strongest and most able international institutions in the world: the\n\u003e North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which has, since its\n\u003e inception, been the fulcrum of transatlantic and inter-European\n\u003e security, and the European Union (EU), our partner in opening world\n\u003e trade.\n\u003e\n\u003e The attacks of September 11 were also an attack on NATO, as NATO itself\n\u003e recognized when it invoked its Article V self-defense clause for the\n\u003e first time. NATO\u0027s core mission -- collective defense of the\n\u003e transatlantic alliance of democracies -- remains, but NATO must develop\n\u003e new structures and capabilities to carry out that mission under new\n\u003e circumstances. NATO must build a capability to field, at short notice,\n\u003e highly mobile, specially trained forces whenever they are needed to\n\u003e respond to a threat against any member of the alliance.\n\u003e\n\u003e The alliance must be able to act wherever our interests are threatened,\n\u003e creating coalitions under NATO\u0027s own mandate, as well as contributing to\n\u003e mission-based coalitions. To achieve this, we must:\n\u003e\n\u003e * expand NATO\u0027s membership to those democratic nations willing and\n\u003e able to share the burden of defending and advancing our common interests;\n\u003e\n\u003e * ensure that the military forces of NATO nations have appropriate\n\u003e combat contributions to make in coalition warfare;\n\u003e\n\u003e * develop planning processes to enable those contributions to become\n\u003e effective multinational fighting forces;\n\u003e\n\u003e * take advantage of the technological opportunities and economies of\n\u003e scale in our defense spending to transform NATO military forces so that\n\u003e they dominate potential aggressors and diminish our vulnerabilities;\n\u003e\n\u003e * streamline and increase the flexibility of command structures to\n\u003e meet new operational demands and the associated requirements of\n\u003e training, integrating, and experimenting with new force configurations;\n\u003e and\n\u003e\n\u003e * maintain the ability to work and fight together as allies even as\n\u003e we take the necessary steps to transform and modernize our forces.\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e If NATO succeeds in enacting these changes, the rewards will be a\n\u003e partnership as central to the security and interests of its member\n\u003e states as was the case during the Cold War. We will sustain a common\n\u003e perspective on the threats to our societies and improve our ability to\n\u003e take common action in defense of our nations and their interests. At the\n\u003e same time, we welcome our European allies\u0027 efforts to forge a greater\n\u003e foreign policy and defense identity with the EU, and commit ourselves to\n\u003e close consultations to ensure that these developments work with NATO. We\n\u003e cannot afford to lose this opportunity to better prepare the family of\n\u003e transatlantic democracies for the challenges to come.\n\u003e\n\u003e The attacks of September 11 energized America\u0027s Asian alliances.\n\u003e Australia invoked the ANZUS Treaty to declare the September 11 was an\n\u003e attack on Australia itself, following that historic decision with the\n\u003e dispatch of some of the world\u0027s finest combat forces for Operation\n\u003e Enduring Freedom. Japan and the Republic of Korea provided unprecedented\n\u003e levels of military logistical support within weeks of the terrorist\n\u003e attack. We have deepened cooperation on counter-terrorism with our\n\u003e alliance partners in Thailand and the Philippines and received\n\u003e invaluable assistance from close friends like Singapore and New Zealand.\n\u003e\n\u003e The war against terrorism has proven that America\u0027s alliances in Asia\n\u003e not only underpin regional peace and stability, but are flexible and\n\u003e ready to deal with new challenges. To enhance our Asian alliances and\n\u003e friendships, we will:\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e * look to Japan to continue forging a leading role in regional and\n\u003e global affairs based on our common interests, our common values, and our\n\u003e close defense and diplomatic cooperation;\n\u003e\n\u003e * work with South Korea to maintain vigilance towards the North while\n\u003e preparing our alliance to make contributions to the broader stability of\n\u003e the region over the longer-term;\n\u003e\n\u003e * build on 50 years of U.S.-Australian alliance cooperation as we\n\u003e continue working together to resolve regional and global problems -- as\n\u003e we have so many times from the Battle of Leyte Gulf to Tora Bora;\n\u003e\n\u003e * maintain forces in the region that reflect our commitments to our\n\u003e allies, our requirements, our technological advances, and the strategic\n\u003e environment; and\n\u003e\n\u003e * build on stability provided by these alliances, as well as with\n\u003e institutions such as ASEAN and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation\n\u003e forum, to develop a mix of regional and bilateral strategies to manage\n\u003e change in this dynamic region.\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e We are attentive to the possible renewal of old patterns of great power\n\u003e competition. Several potential great powers are now in the midst of\n\u003e internal transition -- most importantly Russia, India, and China. In all\n\u003e three cases, recent developments have encouraged our hope that a truly\n\u003e global consensus about basic principles is slowly taking shape.\n\u003e\n\u003e With Russia, we are already building a new strategic relationship based\n\u003e on a central reality of the twenty-first century: the United States and\n\u003e Russia are no longer strategic adversaries. The Moscow Treaty on\n\u003e Strategic Reductions is emblematic of this new reality and reflects a\n\u003e critical change in Russian thinking that promises to lead to productive,\n\u003e long-term relations with the Euro-Atlantic community and the United\n\u003e States. Russia\u0027s top leaders have a realistic assessment of their\n\u003e country\u0027s current weakness and the policies -- internal and external --\n\u003e needed to reverse those weaknesses. They understand, increasingly, that\n\u003e Cold War approaches do not serve their national interests and that\n\u003e Russian and American strategic interests overlap in many areas.\n\u003e\n\u003e United States policy seeks to use this turn in Russian thinking to\n\u003e refocus our relationship on emerging and potential common interests and\n\u003e challenges. We are broadening our already extensive cooperation in the\n\u003e global war on terrorism. We are facilitating Russia\u0027s entry into the\n\u003e World Trade Organization, without lowering standards for accession, to\n\u003e promote beneficial bilateral trade and investment relations. We have\n\u003e created the NATO-Russia Council with the goal of deepening security\n\u003e cooperation among Russia, our European allies, and ourselves. We will\n\u003e continue to bolster the independence and stability of the states of the\n\u003e former Soviet Union in the belief that a prosperous and stable\n\u003e neighborhood will reinforce Russia\u0027s growing commitment to integration\n\u003e into the Euro-Atlantic community.\n\u003e\n\u003e At the same time, we are realistic about the differences that still\n\u003e divide us from Russia and about the time and effort it will take to\n\u003e build an enduring strategic partnership. Lingering distrust of our\n\u003e motives and policies by key Russian elites slows improvement in our\n\u003e relations. Russia\u0027s uneven commitment to the basic values of free-market\n\u003e democracy and dubious record in combating the proliferation of weapons\n\u003e of mass destruction remain matters of great concern. Russia\u0027s very\n\u003e weakness limits the opportunities for cooperation. Nevertheless, those\n\u003e opportunities are vastly greater now than in recent years -- or even\n\u003e decades.\n\u003e\n\u003e The United States has undertaken a transformation in its bilateral\n\u003e relationship with India based on a conviction that U.S. interests\n\u003e require a strong relationship with India. We are the two largest\n\u003e democracies, committed to political freedom protected by representative\n\u003e government. India is moving toward greater economic freedom as well. We\n\u003e have a common interest in the free flow of commerce, including through\n\u003e the vital sea lanes of the Indian Ocean. Finally, we share an interest\n\u003e in fighting terrorism and in creating a strategically stable Asia.\n\u003e\n\u003e Differences remain, including over the development of India\u0027s nuclear\n\u003e and missile programs, and the pace of India\u0027s economic reforms. But\n\u003e while in the past these concerns may have dominated our thinking about\n\u003e India, today we start with a view of India as a growing world power with\n\u003e which we have common strategic interests. Through a strong partnership\n\u003e with India, we can best address any differences and shape a dynamic\n\u003e future.\n\u003e\n\u003e The United States relationship with China is an important part of our\n\u003e strategy to promote a stable, peaceful, and prosperous Asia-Pacific\n\u003e region. We welcome the emergence of a strong, peaceful, and prosperous\n\u003e China. The democratic development of China is crucial to that future.\n\u003e Yet, a quarter century after beginning the process of shedding the worst\n\u003e features of the Communist legacy, China\u0027s leaders have not yet made the\n\u003e next series of fundamental choices about the character of their state.\n\u003e In pursuing advanced military capabilities that can threaten its\n\u003e neighbors in the Asia-Pacific region, China is following an outdated\n\u003e path that, in the end, will hamper its own pursuit of national\n\u003e greatness. In time, China will find that social and political freedom is\n\u003e the only source of that greatness.\n\u003e\n\u003e The United States seeks a constructive relationship with a changing\n\u003e China. We already cooperate well where our interests overlap, including\n\u003e the current war on terrorism and in promoting stability on the Korean\n\u003e peninsula. Likewise, we have coordinated on the future of Afghanistan\n\u003e and have initiated a comprehensive dialogue on counter-terrorism and\n\u003e similar transitional concerns. Shared health and environmental threats,\n\u003e such as the spread of HIV/AIDS, challenge us to promote jointly the\n\u003e welfare of our citizens.\n\u003e\n\u003e Addressing these transnational threats will challenge China to become\n\u003e more open with information, promote the development of civil society,\n\u003e and enhance individual human rights. China has begun to take the road to\n\u003e political openness, permitting many personal freedoms and conducting\n\u003e village-level elections, yet remains strongly committed to national\n\u003e one-party rule by the Communist Party. To make that nation truly\n\u003e accountable to its citizen\u0027s needs and aspirations, however, much work\n\u003e remains to be done. Only by allowing the Chinese people to think,\n\u003e assemble, and worship freely can China reach its full potential.\n\u003e\n\u003e Our important trade relationship will benefit from China\u0027s entry into\n\u003e the World Trade Organization, which will create more export\n\u003e opportunities and ultimately more jobs for American farmers, workers,\n\u003e and companies. China is our fourth largest trading partner, with over\n\u003e $100 billion in annual two-way trade. The power of market principles and\n\u003e the WTO\u0027s requirements for transparency and accountability will advance\n\u003e openness and the rule of law in China to help establish basic\n\u003e protections for commerce and for citizens. There are, however, other\n\u003e areas in which we have profound disagreements. Our commitment to the\n\u003e self-defense of Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act is one. Human\n\u003e rights is another. We expect China to adhere to its nonproliferation\n\u003e commitments. We will work to narrow differences where they exist, but\n\u003e not allow them to preclude cooperation where we agree.\n\u003e\n\u003e The events of September 11, 2001, fundamentally changed the context for\n\u003e relations between the United States and other main centers of global\n\u003e power, and opened vast, new opportunities. With our long-standing allies\n\u003e in Europe and Asia, and with leaders in Russia, India, and China, we\n\u003e must develop active agendas of cooperation lest these relationships\n\u003e become routine and unproductive.\n\u003e\n\u003e Every agency of the United States Government shares the challenge. We\n\u003e can build fruitful habits of consultation, quiet argument, sober\n\u003e analysis, and common action. In the long-term, these are the practices\n\u003e that will sustain the supremacy of our common principles and keep open\n\u003e the path of progress.\n\u003e\n\u003e IX. Transform America\u0027s National Security Institutions to Meet the\n\u003e Challenges and Opportunities of the Twenty-First Century\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e \"Terrorists attacked a symbol of American prosperity. They did not touch\n\u003e its source. America is successful because of the hard work, creativity,\n\u003e and enterprise of our people.\"\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e President Bush\n\u003e Washington, D.C. (Joint Session of Congress)\n\u003e September 20, 2001\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e The major institutions of American national security were designed in a\n\u003e different era to meet different requirements. All of them must be\n\u003e transformed.\n\u003e\n\u003e It is time to reaffirm the essential role of American military strength.\n\u003e We must build and maintain our defenses beyond challenge. Our military\u0027s\n\u003e highest priority is to defend the United States. To do so effectively,\n\u003e our military must:\n\u003e\n\u003e * assure our allies and friends;\n\u003e\n\u003e * dissuade future military competition;\n\u003e\n\u003e * deter threats against U.S. interests, allies, and friends; and\n\u003e\n\u003e * decisively defeat any adversary if deterrence fails.\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e The unparalleled strength of the United States armed forces, and their\n\u003e forward presence, have maintained the peace in some of the world\u0027s most\n\u003e strategically vital regions. However, the threats and enemies we must\n\u003e confront have changed, and so must our forces. A military structured to\n\u003e deter massive Cold War-era armies must be transformed to focus more on\n\u003e how an adversary might fight rather than where and when a war might\n\u003e occur. We will channel our energies to overcome a host of operational\n\u003e challenges.\n\u003e\n\u003e The presence of American forces overseas is one of the most profound\n\u003e symbols of the U.S. commitments to allies and friends. Through our\n\u003e willingness to use force in our own defense and in defense of others,\n\u003e the United States demonstrates its resolve to maintain a balance of\n\u003e power that favors freedom. To contend with uncertainty and to meet the\n\u003e many security challenges we face, the United States will require bases\n\u003e and stations within and beyond Western Europe and Northeast Asia, as\n\u003e well as temporary access arrangements for the long-distance deployment\n\u003e of U.S. forces.\n\u003e\n\u003e Before the war in Afghanistan, that area was low on the list of major\n\u003e planning contingencies. Yet, in a very short time, we had to operate\n\u003e across the length and breadth of that remote nation, using every branch\n\u003e of the armed forces. We must prepare for more such deployments by\n\u003e developing assets such as advanced remote sensing, long-range precision\n\u003e strike capabilities, and transformed maneuver and expeditionary forces.\n\u003e This broad portfolio of military capabilities must also include the\n\u003e ability to defend the homeland, conduct information operations, ensure\n\u003e U.S. access to distant theaters, and protect critical U.S.\n\u003e infrastructure and assets in outer space.\n\u003e\n\u003e Innovation within the armed forces will rest on experimentation with new\n\u003e approaches to warfare, strengthening joint operations, exploiting U.S.\n\u003e intelligence advantages, and taking full advantage of science and\n\u003e technology. We must also transform the way the Department of Defense is\n\u003e run, especially in financial management and recruitment and retention.\n\u003e Finally, while maintaining near-term readiness and the ability to fight\n\u003e the war on terrorism, the goal must be to provide the President with a\n\u003e wider range of military options to discourage aggression or any form of\n\u003e coercion against the United States, our allies, and our friends.\n\u003e\n\u003e We know from history that deterrence can fail; and we know from\n\u003e experience that some enemies cannot be deterred. The United States must\n\u003e and will maintain the capability to defeat any attempt by an enemy --\n\u003e whether a state or non-state actor -- to impose its will on the United\n\u003e States, our allies, or our friends. We will maintain the forces\n\u003e sufficient to support our obligations, and to defend freedom. Our forces\n\u003e will be strong enough to dissuade potential adversaries from pursuing a\n\u003e military build-up in hopes of surpassing, or equaling, the power of the\n\u003e United States.\n\u003e\n\u003e Intelligence -- and how we use it -- is our first line of defense\n\u003e against terrorists and the threat posed by hostile states. Designed\n\u003e around the priority of gathering enormous information about a massive,\n\u003e fixed object -- the Soviet bloc -- the intelligence community is coping\n\u003e with the challenge of following a far more complex and elusive set of\n\u003e targets.\n\u003e\n\u003e We must transform our intelligence capabilities and build new ones to\n\u003e keep pace with the nature of these threats. Intelligence must be\n\u003e appropriately integrated with our defense and law enforcement systems\n\u003e and coordinated with our allies and friends. We need to protect the\n\u003e capabilities we have so that we do not arm our enemies with the\n\u003e knowledge of how best to surprise us. Those who would harm us also seek\n\u003e the benefit of surprise to limit our prevention and response options and\n\u003e to maximize injury.\n\u003e\n\u003e We must strengthen intelligence warning and analysis to provide\n\u003e integrated threat assessments for national and homeland security. Since\n\u003e the threats inspired by foreign governments and groups may be conducted\n\u003e inside the United States, we must also ensure the proper fusion of\n\u003e information between intelligence and law enforcement.\n\u003e\n\u003e Initiatives in this area will include:\n\u003e\n\u003e * strengthening the authority of the Director of Central Intelligence\n\u003e to lead the development and actions of the Nation\u0027s foreign intelligence\n\u003e capabilities;\n\u003e\n\u003e * establishing a new framework for intelligence warning that provides\n\u003e seamless and integrated warning across the spectrum of threats facing\n\u003e the nation and our allies;\n\u003e\n\u003e * continuing to develop new methods of collecting information to\n\u003e sustain our intelligence advantage;\n\u003e\n\u003e * investing in future capabilities while working to protect them\n\u003e through a more vigorous effort to prevent the compromise of intelligence\n\u003e capabilities; and\n\u003e\n\u003e * collecting intelligence against the terrorist danger across the\n\u003e government with all-source analysis.\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e As the United States Government relies on the armed forces to defend\n\u003e America\u0027s interests, it must rely on diplomacy to interact with other\n\u003e nations. We will ensure that the Department of State receives funding\n\u003e sufficient to ensure the success of American diplomacy. The State\n\u003e Department takes the lead in managing our bilateral relationships with\n\u003e other governments. And in this new era, its people and institutions must\n\u003e be able to interact equally adroitly with non-governmental organizations\n\u003e and international institutions. Officials trained mainly in\n\u003e international politics must also extend their reach to understand\n\u003e complex issues of domestic governance around the world, including public\n\u003e health, education, law enforcement, the judiciary, and public diplomacy.\n\u003e\n\u003e Our diplomats serve at the front line of complex negotiations, civil\n\u003e wars, and other humanitarian catastrophes. As humanitarian relief\n\u003e requirements are better understood, we must also be able to help build\n\u003e police forces, court systems, and legal codes, local and provincial\n\u003e government institutions, and electoral systems. Effective international\n\u003e cooperation is needed to accomplish these goals, backed by American\n\u003e readiness to play our part.\n\u003e\n\u003e Just as our diplomatic institutions must adapt so that we can reach out\n\u003e to others, we also need a different and more comprehensive approach to\n\u003e public information efforts that can help people around the world learn\n\u003e about and understand America. The war on terrorism is not a clash of\n\u003e civilizations. It does, however, reveal the clash inside a civilization,\n\u003e a battle for the future of the Muslim world. This is a struggle of ideas\n\u003e and this is an area where America must excel.\n\u003e\n\u003e We will take the actions necessary to ensure that our efforts to meet\n\u003e our global security commitments and protect Americans are not impaired\n\u003e by the potential for investigations, inquiry, or prosecution by the\n\u003e International Criminal Court (ICC), whose jurisdiction does not extend\n\u003e to Americans and which we do not accept. We will work together with\n\u003e other nations to avoid complications in our military operations and\n\u003e cooperation, through such mechanisms as multilateral and bilateral\n\u003e agreements that will protect U.S. nationals from the ICC. We will\n\u003e implement fully the American Servicemembers Protection Act, whose\n\u003e provisions are intended to ensure and enhance the protection of U.S.\n\u003e personnel and officials.\n\u003e\n\u003e We will make hard choices in the coming year and beyond to ensure the\n\u003e right level and allocation of government spending on national security.\n\u003e The United States Government must strengthen its defenses to win this\n\u003e war. At home, our most important priority is to protect the homeland for\n\u003e the American people.\n\u003e\n\u003e Today, the distinction between domestic and foreign affairs is\n\u003e diminishing. In a globalized world, events beyond America\u0027s borders have\n\u003e a greater impact inside them. Our society must be open to people, ideas,\n\u003e and goods from across the globe. The characteristics we most cherish --\n\u003e our freedom, our cities, our systems of movement, and modern life -- are\n\u003e vulnerable to terrorism. This vulnerability will persist long after we\n\u003e bring to justice those responsible for the September eleventh attacks.\n\u003e As time passes, individuals may gain access to means of destruction that\n\u003e until now could be wielded only by armies, fleets, and squadrons. This\n\u003e is a new condition of life. We will adjust to it and thrive -- in spite\n\u003e of it.\n\u003e\n\u003e In exercising our leadership, we will respect the values, judgment, and\n\u003e interests of our friends and partners. Still, we will be prepared to act\n\u003e apart when our interests and unique responsibilities require. When we\n\u003e disagree on particulars, we will explain forthrightly the grounds for\n\u003e our concerns and strive to forge viable alternatives. We will not allow\n\u003e such disagreements to obscure our determination to secure together, with\n\u003e our allies and our friends, our shared fundamental interests and values.\n\u003e\n\u003e Ultimately, the foundation of American strength is at home. It is in the\n\u003e skills of our people, the dynamism of our economy, and the resilience of\n\u003e our institutions. A diverse, modern society has inherent, ambitious,\n\u003e entrepreneurial energy. Our strength comes from what we do with that\n\u003e energy. That is where our national security begins.\n\u003e\n\n",

You know\n\u0027weapons of mass destruction\u0027. etc. etc.\n\n\u003d\u003d\nhttp://dc.internet.com/news/article.php/10849_1467121\n\nSeptember 20, 2002\nSenate Committee Passes Nanotech Bill\nBy Roy Mark\n\nThe Senate Commerce Committee unanimously passed on Thursday legislation to\npromote nanotechnology research and development. Introduced by Sen. Ron\nWyden (D-Ore.), the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act\nwould create the National Nanotechnology Research Program. The bill is\nco-sponsored by Sen. Joe Lieberman (D-Conn.) and Sen. George Allen (R-Va.).\n\nThe proposed program would be a coordinated interagency effort that would\nsupport long-term nanoscale research and development and promote effective\neducation and training for the next generation of nanotechnology researchers\nand professionals.\n\n\"The unanimous support of the Senate Commerce Committee is a very big step\nforward for this very small technology,\" Lieberman, who vowed to pushed to\nfull Senate passage before the end of the year, said. \"Nowhere in the world\nare the wheels of innovation spinning more rapidly than in the realm of\nnanotechnology. The U.S. certainly possesses the raw resources and talent to\nlead the world in developing this technology. Our legislation will provide\nthe nation with a long-term focus and sustained commitment, and facilitate\nnew collaborations between government, academia, and industry that will\nensure our place at the head of the next wave of innovation.\"\n\nThe bill would place coordination and management of the nanotechnology\nprogram under the National Science and Technology Council. It would also\ncreate a Presidential National Nanotechnology Advisory Panel and National\nNanotechnology Coordination Office, which would provide administrative and\ntechnical support for the Advisory Panel and the Council.\n\n\"My own judgment is the nanotechnology revolution has the potential to\nchange America on a scale equal to, if not greater than, the computer\nrevolution. I am determined that the United States will not miss, but will\nmine the opportunities of nanotechnology,\" Wyden said in introducing the\nbill. \"At present, efforts in the nanotechnology field are strewn across a\nhalf-dozen federal agencies. I want America to marshal its various\nnanotechnology efforts into one driving force to remain the world\u0027s leader\nin this burgeoning field. And I believe federal support is essential to\nachieving that goal.\n\nTo study the potential long-term effects of nanotechnology, a new Center for\nSocietal, Ethical, Educational, Legal and Workforce Issues Related to\nNanotechnology would also be established.\n\nAccording to Lieberman, the bill closely tracks the recommendations of the\nNational Research Council (NRC), which completed a thorough review of the\nNational Nanotechnology Initiative in June.\n\nThose recommendations included establishing an independent advisory panel;\nemphasizing long-term goals; striking a balance between long-term and\nshort-term research; supporting the development of research facilities,\nequipment and instrumentation; creating special funding to support research\nthat falls in the breach between agency missions and programs; promoting\ninterdisciplinary research and research groups; facilitating technology\ntransition and outreach to industry; conducting studies on the societal\nimplications of nanotechnology, including those related to ethical,\neducational, legal and workforce issues; and the development of metrics for\nmeasuring progress toward program goals.\n\n\n",

    "message": "\n\nRelated to the MS acquisition of XDegrees?\n\n\u003d\u003d\nhttp://www.internetnews.com/infra/article.php/1466271\n\nSun Nabs Storage Startup\nBy Clint Boulton\nAmid the flurry of news at its own SunNetwork 2002 conference in San\nFrancisco, Sun Microsystems Thursday said it has agreed to purchase data\nstorage concern Pirus Networks for an undisclosed amount of stock.\n\nThe Palo Alto, Calif. networking firm bought the Acton, Mass.-based startup\nwith a keen eye for the startup\u0027s switching (define) devices and\nvirtualization technology. Used as part of a storage area network (define),\nvirtualization is the pooling of storage from many network storage devices\ninto what appears to the operating system to be a single storage device that\nis managed from a central console.\n\nThough major vendors make similar technology, Pirus competes with the likes\nof Rhapsody Networks and Confluence Networks. Sun plucked Pirus after\nscouting some 65 companies.\n\nMark Lovington, vice president of marketing for Pirus, told internetnews.com\nthat Pirus and Sun have been in discussion for a while about a possible\nacquisition. Pirus, he said, succeeded in a goal it shares with a lot of\nstorage startups -- to be acquired by one of the major systems vendors, such\nas Sun IBM, HP, Hitachi.\n\n\"This is a huge opportunity for Pirus in a storage market dominated by 6,7\nor 8 system-level players,\" Lovington said. \"Sun sees this acquisition as a\ncritical element to their N1 initiative. The synergies were quite obvious.\"\n\nN1 is Sun\u0027s hopeful tour de force in distributed computing (define)\narchitecture, which involves multiple, remote computers that each have a\nrole in a computation problem or information processing. N1 is being styled\nas the answer for companies looking to manage groups of computers and\nnetworks as a single system -- at a lower cost and with greater flexibility.\n\nWhile lagging behind other, more entrenched players, Sun is gaining ground\nin the storage market with its Sun StorEdge Complete Storage Solutions,\naccording to a new report by IDC. John McArthur, group vice president of\nIDC\u0027s Storage program, said Sun Microsystems and IBM posted the largest\nincreases in total storage revenue over Q1 2002, with 32% and 11% gains,\nrespectively. As of Q2, Sun held a 9 percent market share, with revenues of\n$411 million.\n\nSun\u0027s acquisition of Pirus is expected to close in the second quarter of\nSun\u0027s 2003 fiscal year, which ends December 29, 2002.\n\n\n",

Like group rights, \"disparity\" in wealth is\nstatistical sophistry.\n\n\nBesides, even if you can\u0027t help the distribution, industrial wealth\nis almost always transitory, and so is relative poverty, even when\nthere are no confiscatory death-taxes. The 20th anniversary Forbes\n400 just came out, and only a few tens of people are still there\nsince 1982, a time which had significantly higher marginal taxes on\nwealth, income, and inheritance than we do now. More to the point,\nthey\u0027re nowhere near the top.\n\nI\u0027ll take those odds. It is only when neofeudalism reasserts itself,\nin the form of government regulation, confiscatory taxes, legislated\nmonopoly, corporate welfare, \"non-profit\" neoaristocratic tax dodges,\nand legalized labor extortion that we get slowdowns in progress, like\nwhat happened in Fabian-era Britain, or 1970\u0027s USA.\n\nIn fact, it is in countries where wealth is the most \"unfairly\"\ndistributed, that you get the most improvement in the general --\neconomic -- welfare. More stuff cheaper, fewer people dying, more\npeople living longer.\n\nI\u0027ll take those odds as well.

It\nsounds like a modern Keynsian was creating an urban legend.)\n\nOTOH the lack of sufficient circulating monetary instruments was\neconomically crippling.

The fundamental cause of the American Great Depression was\nexactly this, courtesy of the Federal Reserve Board.\n\nI don\u0027t think shifting the power to print money to the bank of Canada\nhad much effect.

Ben\n\u003e explained that they used \"Colonial Script\", a kind of barter-dollar,\n\u003e and increasing the supply of script ensured complete employment.  The\n\u003e British bankers were furious and immediately lobbied parliament to\n\u003e clamp down on the practice.  Within a few years, the colonies were\n\u003e rife with unemployment and poverty just like the rest of the Empire.\n\u003e \n\u003e According to questionable literature handed out by a fringe political\n\u003e party here in Canada, the Founding Fathers had no real complaint about\n\u003e tea taxes, it was the banning of colonial script they were\n\u003e protesting.

Can you say\n\"Bootstraps\", boys and girls? I knew you could...\n\n[Given that an undergraduate liberal arts degree from a state school,\nlike, say, mine, :-), is nothing but stuff they should have taught\nyou in a government-run \"high\" school, you\u0027ll probably get more of\n*those* on the Forbes 400 as well as time goes on. If we ever get\naround to having a good old fashioned government-collapsing\ntransfer-payment depression (an economic version of this summer\u0027s\ngovernment-forest conflagration, caused by the same kind of\ninnumeracy that not clear-cutting enough forests did out west this\nsummer :-)) that should motivate more than a few erst-slackers out\nthere, including me, :-), to learn to actually feed themselves.]\n\n\nThe *next* category on the Forbes 400 list is someone with a\n\"terminal\" professional degree, like an MBA, PhD, MD, etc., from the\nbest school possible.\n\nWhy? Because, as of about 1950, the *best* way to get into Harvard,\nfor instance, is to be *smart*, not rich. Don\u0027t take my word for it,\nask their admissions office. Look at the admissions stats over the\nyears for proof.\n\nMeritocracy, American Style, was *invented* at the Ivy League after\nWorld War II. Even Stanford got the hint, :-), and, of course,\nChicago taught them all how, right? :-). Practically *nobody* who\ngoes to a top-20 American institution of higher learning can actually\nafford to go there these days. Unless, of course, their parents, who\ncouldn\u0027t afford to go there themselves, got terminal degrees in the\nlast 40 years or so. And their kids *still* had to get the grades,\nand \"biased\" (by intelligence :-)), test scores, to get in.\n\n\nThe bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with \"terminal\"\ndegrees, until they actually *own* something and *hire* people, or\nlearn to *make* something for a living all day on a profit and loss\nbasis, persist in the practically insane belief, like life after\ndeath, that economics is some kind of zero sum game, that dumb people\nwho don\u0027t work hard for it make all the money, and, if someone *is*\nsmart, works hard, and is rich, then they stole their wealth somehow.\n\nBTW, none of you guys out there holding the short end of this\nrhetorical stick can blame *me* for the fact that I\u0027m using it to\nbeat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders. You\nwere, apparently, too dumb to grab the right end. *I* went to\nMissouri, and *I* don\u0027t have a degree in anything actually useful,\nmuch less a \"terminal\" one, which means *I*\u0027m broker than anyone on\nthis list -- it\u0027s just that *you*, of all people, lots with\neducations far surpassing my own, should just plain know better. The\nfacts speak for themselves, if you just open your eyes and *look*.\nThere are no epicycles, the universe does not orbit the earth, and\neconomics is not a zero-sum game. The cost of anything, including\nignorance and destitution, is the forgone alternative, in this case,\nintelligence and effort.\n\n[I will, however, admit to being educated *waay* past my level of\ncompetence, and, by the way *you* discuss economics, so have you,\napparently.]\n\n\n\nBTW, if we ever actually *had* free markets in this country,\n*including* the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes,\nall those smart people in the Forbes 400 would have *more* money, and\nthere would be *more* self-made people on that list. In addition,\nmost of the people who *inherited* money on the list would have\n*much* less of it, not even relatively speaking. Finally, practically\nall of that \"new\" money would have come from economic efficiency and\nnot \"stolen\" from someone else, investment bubbles or not.\n\nThat efficiency is called \"progress\", for those of you in The\nPeople\u0027s Republics of Berkeley or Cambridge. It means more and better\nstuff, cheaper, over time -- a terrible, petit-bourgeois concept\napparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite, or you\u0027d\nknow about it by now. In economic terms, it\u0027s also called an increase\nin general welfare, and, no, Virginia, I\u0027m not talking about\nextorting money from someone who works, and giving it to someone who\ndoesn\u0027t in order to keep them from working and they can think of some\npolitician as Santa Claus come election time...\n\n\nIn short, then, economics is not a zero sum game, property is not\ntheft, the rich don\u0027t get rich off the backs of the poor, and\nredistributionist labor \"theory\" of value happy horseshit is just\nthat: horseshit, happy or otherwise.\n\nTo believe otherwise, is -- quite literally, given the time Marx\nwrote Capital and the Manifesto -- romantic nonsense.\n\nCheers,\nRAH\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: PGP 7.5\n\niQA/AwUBPY511cPxH8jf3ohaEQLAsgCfZhsQMSvUy6GqJ5wgL52DwZKpIhMAnRuR\nYYboc+IcylP5TlKL58jpwEfu\n\u003dz877\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n-- \n-----------------\nR.

The passenger, Steven Feuer, had nothing to do\nwith Dr. Rajcoomar.\n\nTwo U.S. air marshals got up from their seats in first class and moved back\nto coach to confront Mr. Feuer, who was described by witnesses as a slight\nman who seemed disoriented. What ensued was terrifying. When Mr. Feuer\nrefused to remain in his seat, the marshals reacted as if they were trying\nout for the lead roles in Hollywood\u0027s latest action extravaganza.\n\nThey handcuffed Mr. Feuer, hustled him into first class and restrained him\nin a seat next to Dr. Rajcoomar. The 180 or so passengers were now quite\njittery. Dr. Rajcoomar asked to have his seat changed and a flight\nattendant obliged, finding him another seat in first class. The incident,\nalready scary, could - and should - have ended there. But the marshals were\nnot ready to let things quiet down.\n\nOne of the marshals pulled a gun and brandished it at the passengers. The\nmarshals loudly demanded that all passengers remain in their seats, and\nremain still. They barked a series of orders. No one should stand for any\nreason. Arms and legs should not extend into the aisles. No one should try\nto visit the restroom. The message could not have been clearer: anyone who\ndisobeyed the marshals was in danger of being shot.\n\nThe passengers were petrified, with most believing that there were\nterrorists on the plane.\n\n\"I was afraid there was going to be a gun battle in that pressurized\ncabin,\" said Senior Judge James A. Lineberger of the Philadelphia Court of\nCommon Pleas, a veteran of 20 years in the military, who was sitting in an\naisle seat in coach. \"I was afraid that I was going to die from the gunfire\nin a shootout.\"\n\nDr. Rajcoomar\u0027s wife, Dorothy, who was seated quite a distance from her\nhusband, said, \"It was really like Rambo in the air.\" She worried that\nthere might be people on the plane who did not speak English, and therefore\ndid not understand the marshals\u0027 orders. If someone got up to go to the\nbathroom, he or she might be shot.\n\nThere were no terrorists on board. There was no threat of any kind. When\nthe plane landed about half an hour later, Mr. Feuer was taken into\ncustody. And then, shockingly, so was Dr. Rajcoomar. The air marshals\ngrabbed the doctor from behind, handcuffed him and, for no good reason that\nanyone has been able to give, hauled him to an airport police station where\nhe was thrown into a filthy cell.\n\nThis was airline security gone berserk. No one ever suggested that Dr.\nRajcoomar, a straight-arrow retired Army major, had done anything wrong.\n\nDr. Rajcoomar, who is of Indian descent, said he believes he was taken into\ncustody solely because of his brown skin. He was held for three frightening\nhours and then released without being charged. Mr. Feuer was also released.\n\nOfficials tried to conceal the names of the marshals, but they were\neventually identified by a Philadelphia Inquirer reporter as Shawn B.\nMcCullers and Samuel Mumma of the Transportation Security Administration,\nwhich is part of the U.S. Transportation Department.\n\nThe Transportation Security Administration has declined to discuss the\nincident in detail. A spokesman offered the absurd explanation that Dr.\nRajcoomar was detained because he had watched the unfolding incident \"too\nclosely.\"\n\nIf that becomes a criterion for arrest in the U.S., a lot of us reporters\nare headed for jail.\n\nDr. Rajcoomar told me yesterday that he remains shaken by the episode. \"I\nhad never been treated like that in my life,\" he said. \"I was afraid that I\nwas about to be beaten up or killed.\"\n\nLawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union have taken up his case and\nhe has filed notice that he may sue the federal government for unlawful\ndetention.\n\n\"We have to take a look at what we\u0027re doing in the name of security,\" said\nDr. Rajcoomar. \"So many men and women have fought and died for freedom in\nthis great country, and now we are in danger of ruining that in the name of\nsecurity.\"\n\n-- \n-----------------\nR.

    "subject": "Rebuild at Ground Zero",
    "message": "\nhttp://online.wsj.com/article_print/0,,SB10327475102363433,00.html\n\n\nThe Wall Street Journal\n\nSeptember 23, 2002\nCOMMENTARY\n\nRebuild at Ground Zero\n\nBy LARRY SILVERSTEIN\n\nEarlier this month, we New Yorkers observed the solemn anniversary of the\nhorrific events that befell our city on Sept. 11, 2001. All of those who\nperished must never be forgotten. The footprints of the fallen Twin Towers\nand a portion of the 16-acre site must be dedicated to a memorial and civic\namenities that recall the sacrifices that were made there and the anguish\nthat those senseless acts of terror created for the victims\u0027 families and,\nindeed, for all of us.\n\nBut for the good of the city and the region, the 10-million-plus square\nfeet of commercial and retail space that was destroyed with the Twin Towers\nmust be replaced on the site.\n\nAbout 50,000 people worked in the World Trade Center. Those jobs are lost,\nalong with those of another 50,000 people who worked in the vicinity.\nTogether, those jobs in lower Manhattan, for which the Trade Center was the\neconomic stimulus, produced annual gross wages of about $47 billion, or 15%\nof the annual gross wages earned in the entire state. Some of the firms\nhave relocated elsewhere in the city and region, but many have not. New\nYork City is facing a budget deficit. Without additional jobs, the deficit\nmay become permanent. This is one reason for the importance of rebuilding.\n\nIf we do not replace the lost space, lower Manhattan never will regain the\nvibrancy it had as the world\u0027s financial center. Love them or hate them,\nand there were lots of New Yorkers on both sides of the issue, the Towers\nmade a powerful statement to the world that said, \"This is New York, a\nsymbol of our free economy and of our way of life.\" That is why they were\ndestroyed. This is a second reason why the towers must be replaced, and\nwith buildings that make a potent architectural statement.\n\nIn recent weeks, redevelopment proposals have been circulated from many\nsources. Most of these focus not on the Trade Center site, however, but on\nall of lower Manhattan. Further, many believe that the 10 million square\nfeet either could be located elsewhere, scattered in several sites, or\nsimply never rebuilt.\n\nThese proposals miss the point. What was destroyed, and what must be\nrecovered, was the Trade Center, not all of lower Manhattan. Except over\nthe towers\u0027 footprints, where there must be no commercial development, the\noffice and retail space lost has to be rebuilt on or close to where it was.\n\nAccess to mass transit makes the site ideal for office space of this size.\nThat was a major reason why the Twin Towers were leased to 97% occupancy\nbefore 9/11. None of the other sites proposed for office development has\nremotely equal transportation access. With the reconstruction of the subway\nand PATH stations, plus an additional $4.5 billion in transit improvements\nplanned, such as the new Fulton Transit Center and the direct\n\"Train-to-the-Plane\" Long Island Rail Road connection, the site becomes\neven more the logical locus of office development.\n\nAnd New York will need the space. Before 9/11, the Group of 35, a task\nforce of civic leaders led by Sen. Charles Schumer and former Treasury\nSecretary Robert Rubin, concluded that the city would need an additional 60\nmillion square feet of new office space by 2020 to accommodate the\nanticipated addition of 300,000 new jobs. The loss of the Twin Towers only\nheightens the need.\n\nAs for those who say that 10 million square feet of office space downtown\ncannot be absorbed by the real estate market, I would simply point out that\nhistory shows them wrong. New York now has about 400 million square feet of\noffice space. All new construction underway already is substantially leased\nup. New York had 48 million square feet of vacant office space at the\nbeginning of the recession in 1990. By 1998, this space had been absorbed,\nat an annual rate of about 6 million square feet.\n\nWe are seeking to rebuild 10 million square feet on the Trade Center site\nover a period of about 10 years, with the first buildings not coming on\nline until 2008 and the project reaching completion in 2012. This is an\nannual absorption rate of about a million feet, much lower than the 1990s\u0027\nrate.\n\nThose who argue that New York cannot reabsorb office space that it\npreviously had are saying that the city has had its day and is entering an\nextended period of stagnation and decline. I will not accept this view, nor\nwill most New Yorkers.\n\nMayor Michael Bloomberg said in a recent interview with the New York Times\nthat the city \"has to do two things: memorialize, but also build for the\nfuture.\" I believe that the Twin Towers site can gracefully accommodate --\nand that downtown requires -- office and retail space of architectural\nsignificance, a dignified memorial that both witnesses and recalls what\nhappened, and cultural amenities that would benefit workers as well as\nresidents of the area.\n\nThe challenge to accomplish this is enormous. But our city is up to the task.\n\nMr. Silverstein is president of Silverstein Properties, a real estate firm\nwhose affiliates hold 99-year leases on the World Trade Center site.\n\n-- \n-----------------\nR.

Assistant Police Chief Terrance Gainer told a\ncongressional hearing on Friday that law authorities\nwere in talks to decide whether planned protests were,\n\"so deleterious to security efforts that we ought to\ntake proactive action.\"\n\nSeveral thousand people are expected to demonstrate\noutside the IMF and World Bank headquarters next\nweekend.\n\nThe Anti-Capitalist Convergence, a D.C.-based\nanarchist group, is also planning a day-long traffic\nblockade, banner-drops and protests against major\ncorporations in the downtown core.\n\nChuck, the 37 year-old webmaster of the anarchist site\nwww.infoshop.org who declined to give his last name,\ntold Reuters his scavenger hunt was meant as a joke.\n\n\"People were asking for things to do when they come to\nD.C.

Can you say\n\u003e\"Bootstraps\", boys and girls? I knew you could...\n\u003e  \n\u003e\nSure - discussion in Forbes - rigorous research, that. Especially when \nthe data in their own list\ncontradicts them. I continue to look at the list and all the \"inherited, \ngrowed\" entries. I guess if\nI read it enough times my vision will clear.\n\n\u003e[Given that an undergraduate liberal arts degree from a state school,\n\u003elike, say, mine, :-), is nothing but stuff they should have taught\n\u003eyou in a government-run \"high\" school, you\u0027ll probably get more of\n\u003e*those* on the Forbes 400 as well as time goes on. If we ever get\n\u003earound to having a good old fashioned government-collapsing\n\u003etransfer-payment depression (an economic version of this summer\u0027s\n\u003egovernment-forest conflagration, caused by the same kind of\n\u003einnumeracy that not clear-cutting enough forests did out west this\n\u003esummer :-)) that should motivate more than a few erst-slackers out\n\u003ethere, including me, :-), to learn to actually feed themselves.]\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003eThe *next* category on the Forbes 400 list is someone with a\n\u003e\"terminal\" professional degree, like an MBA, PhD, MD, etc., from the\n\u003ebest school possible.\n\u003e\n\u003eWhy? Because, as of about 1950, the *best* way to get into Harvard,\n\u003efor instance, is to be *smart*, not rich. Don\u0027t take my word for it,\n\u003eask their admissions office. Look at the admissions stats over the\n\u003eyears for proof.\n\u003e  \n\u003e\nI, at on point, looked into Stanford Business School. After learning \nthat tuition was \u003e 20K,\nno financial aid was available, and part-time work was disallowed, this \nsmart user decided\nthat I was not willing to spend the $150 application fee \n(non-refundable). During attendance at\nmy local business school, I was told repeatedly I should have gone for \nit - to quote a prof, (Northwestern MBA), it\nhas nothing to do with the education you receive - in general European \n(and Canadian) business\nschools are better and more innovative - its the connections. He used \nthe words \"American nobility.\"\n\n\u003eMeritocracy, American Style, was *invented* at the Ivy League after\n\u003eWorld War II. Even Stanford got the hint, :-), and, of course,\n\u003eChicago taught them all how, right? :-). Practically *nobody* who\n\u003egoes to a top-20 American institution of higher learning can actually\n\u003eafford to go there these days. Unless, of course, their parents, who\n\u003ecouldn\u0027t afford to go there themselves, got terminal degrees in the\n\u003elast 40 years or so. And their kids *still* had to get the grades,\n\u003eand \"biased\" (by intelligence :-)), test scores, to get in.\n\u003e  \n\u003e\n\"invented\" being the right word. Dubya went to Yale and HBS. I guess \n\"practically\" gets you\naround that problem.\n\n\u003e\n\u003eThe bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with \"terminal\"\n\u003edegrees, until they actually *own* something and *hire* people, or\n\u003elearn to *make* something for a living all day on a profit and loss\n\u003ebasis, persist in the practically insane belief, like life after\n\u003edeath, that economics is some kind of zero sum game, that dumb people\n\u003ewho don\u0027t work hard for it make all the money, and, if someone *is*\n\u003esmart, works hard, and is rich, then they stole their wealth somehow.\n\u003e\n\u003eBTW, none of you guys out there holding the short end of this\n\u003erhetorical stick can blame *me* for the fact that I\u0027m using it to\n\u003ebeat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders. You\n\u003ewere, apparently, too dumb to grab the right end. *I* went to\n\u003eMissouri, and *I* don\u0027t have a degree in anything actually useful,\n\u003emuch less a \"terminal\" one, which means *I*\u0027m broker than anyone on\n\u003ethis list -- it\u0027s just that *you*, of all people, lots with\n\u003eeducations far surpassing my own, should just plain know better. The\n\u003efacts speak for themselves, if you just open your eyes and *look*.\n\u003eThere are no epicycles, the universe does not orbit the earth, and\n\u003eeconomics is not a zero-sum game. The cost of anything, including\n\u003eignorance and destitution, is the forgone alternative, in this case,\n\u003eintelligence and effort.\n\u003e\n\u003e[I will, however, admit to being educated *waay* past my level of\n\u003ecompetence, and, by the way *you* discuss economics, so have you,\n\u003eapparently.]\n\u003e\n\u003e  \n\u003e\nIts interesting but in this part of the World (Nova Scotia) a recent \nstudy found that college graduates\nearn less than graduates of 2 year community colleges (trade schools). \nThey did decline to mention\nthat the demand for some trades  is so great that some of\nthem are demanding university degrees to get in. Just for the record - \nthe average salary for\na university graduate (including advanced degree holders) here is C$ \n21,000  -- \u003c $14,000 US. No wonder\nhalf of San Francisco has set up here - we have a whole whack of call \ncenters that\nhave arrived here in the last couple of years - I think they hire some \nentry level IT people for around $10 ($6 US) an\nhour, which of course, fits perfectly for me - my entry level job, in \n1986, paid $11.00 an hour. The fundamental difference\nis that most of the jobs that require a trade are *unionized*.In other \nwords, in this part of the world, for the vast majority of people, \n union dues are a better investment than tuition. The counter-argument \nto this is that many college graduates\n leave for better work elsewhere, but the counter-counter argument is \nthat we are the thin edge\n(one of several really - prison labor in the US would be another) of \nthird-world wages and work practices coming\n to North America.\n\nI worked at a company that had a 14-year wage freeze. The fact that they \ncould maintain that (and prosper) just says\n volumes about the economy in this part of the world. I met many people \nthere, like me, who felt that was fine, I can vote\nwith my feet. They didn\u0027t quite realize that just about every large \nemployer in the area has similar, or worse, policies. Anyway\neventually they started a union drive. During the vote, retired \nemployees were brought in by the employer (rumours were\nthat they were paid the going rate for a vote around here - a bottle of \nrum) and somehow allowed to vote . The union filed\n a grievance - which was denied - by a Minister of Labour, who, hey, \nguess what - used to be a VP at the company.\nThat\u0027s free labor markets at work. The business continues to prosper - \nas I was told when I was there -  it is a cash cow as long\nas the JOA (Joint Operating Agreement) with the competing paper is in \nplace.\n\nAnd if you think that any of those wonderful American companies, out of \nsome free-enterprise belief in competing for the best talent,\nare going to do anything about that, sorry, most of them received \ngenerous subsidies, in return, I\u0027m sure, for an understanding about\nthe labor markets here.\n\n\u003e\n\u003eBTW, if we ever actually *had* free markets in this country,\n\u003e*including* the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes,\n\u003eall those smart people in the Forbes 400 would have *more* money, and\n\u003ethere would be *more* self-made people on that list. In addition,\n\u003emost of the people who *inherited* money on the list would have\n\u003e*much* less of it, not even relatively speaking. Finally, practically\n\u003eall of that \"new\" money would have come from economic efficiency and\n\u003enot \"stolen\" from someone else, investment bubbles or not.\n\u003e\n\u003eThat efficiency is called \"progress\", for those of you in The\n\u003ePeople\u0027s Republics of Berkeley or Cambridge. It means more and better\n\u003estuff, cheaper, over time -- a terrible, petit-bourgeois concept\n\u003eapparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite, or you\u0027d\n\u003eknow about it by now. In economic terms, it\u0027s also called an increase\n\u003ein general welfare, and, no, Virginia, I\u0027m not talking about\n\u003eextorting money from someone who works, and giving it to someone who\n\u003edoesn\u0027t in order to keep them from working and they can think of some\n\u003epolitician as Santa Claus come election time...\n\u003e  \n\u003e\nMuch as I like to accept what you say - I do believe in free markets , I \nhave difficulty finding any - except of course for\nlabor markets, which governments go to great lengths to protect (well \nunless the supply is tight)\nIt was a great run with the technology industry - producing most of the \nself-made billionaires on\nthe list, but now we\u0027ve got a government-sponsored monopoly, and the \nconcept of \"more stuff, cheaper\"\nwhich it has always promised - seems to be disappearing. A particularly \ngalling example is\nhigh-speed internet access. An article I read a couple of years ago that \nit is an area where the pricing\napproaches of the IT industry (cheaper, better or you die) and the \ntelecom industry (maintain your\nmonopoly through regulation, and get guaranteed price increases through \nthe same regulators) meet.\nSadly to say, the telecom industry seems to have won. The whole \nentertainment industry/RIAA/Palladium thing\nseems to be another instance where actually giving value to the customer \nseems less important than using\nregulation to reduce competition and substitute products in order to \nproduce profits for the favored few.\n\n\u003e\n\u003eIn short, then, economics is not a zero sum game, property is not\n\u003etheft, the rich don\u0027t get rich off the backs of the poor, and\n\u003eredistributionist labor \"theory\" of value happy horseshit is just\n\u003ethat: horseshit, happy or otherwise.\n\u003e\n\u003eTo believe otherwise, is -- quite literally, given the time Marx\n\u003ewrote Capital and the Manifesto -- romantic nonsense.\n\u003e  \n\u003e\nI usually agree - but when there\u0027s a Republican in office -  I feel like \nthey\u0027re the biggest believers in\nthe Manifesto, in reverse. Create a reserve pool of labor, reduce the \nrights of that \"proletariat\" you\u0027ve\njust created with bogus \"law and order\" policies , concentrate capital \nin the hands of a few (ideally people\nwho can get you reelected) and the economy will take care of itself. Oh, \nand lie - use\nthe word \"compassionate\" a lot. I guess I tend to believe that a certain \namount of poverty reduction actually\nhelps a modern capitalist state - the basic economic tenet of the \nRepublic party seems to be the more homeless under\n each overpass, the more efficient the rest of us will be.\n\nAnd the facts are, for most people in the Western world  are declining \nstandards of living, declining benefits, disappearing social safety net,\ngreater working hours,  essentially since the entrance of women into the \nwork force (not blaming women in any way, they have a right\n to work but its now 2 wage-earners in each family and still declining \nstandards of living) is the reality.\n\nAgain to quote that wonderfully liberal document I keep coming back to - \nthe CIA world factbook - on the US economy:\n\n\"Since 1975, practically all the gains in household income have gone to \nthe top 20% of households\"\n\nOwen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The news here is that the\ntemperature measures via sattelite have gotten even better and they have\nbeen validated with a different means of measurement.\n\nRather than have to defend CO2 concentrations as not causing global\nwarming, people who believe in CO2 need a good explanation of the\n\"Medieval Warm Period\".  Said period was warmer than what we have now,\nand it obvioiusly wasn\u0027t caused by CO2.\n\nIn point of fact the predicted global warming due to CO2 is not caused\nDIRECTLY by CO2.  CO2 doesn\u0027t trap that much heat.  Water vapor does,\nand if you can get more water vapor in the air due to CO2 then you have\nyour warming theory.\n\nYet it would seem that the very stability of the earth\u0027s climate over\nlong periods argues not for an unstable system with positive feedback\nloops but one where negative feedback loops predominate.\n\nMore water vapor can increase temperatuers, but that also leads to more\nclouds.

    "message": "\n\u003e \"the historical record\", by which you mean *human* historical record, is\n\u003e highly overrated (nigh worthless) when you are talking about geological\n\u003e timescales, even on topics with as short a timescale as climate.\n\nThere has been a significant recent increase in global CO2 concentrations.\nThe vast preponderance of the new CO2 in the atmosphere is due to human\nactivity starting around the industrialization of Europe, and accelerating\nafter WWII. Most scientists studying global climate change believe that\nthese increased CO2 concentrations are the primary causal agent for\nincreased global warming. Hence our interest in items of human time scale.\n\n\u003e It is worth noting that underneath the receding glaciers deposited\n\u003e during the last major ice age, they are finding substantial evidence of\n\u003e humans living in what was a nice temperate climate before the glaciers\n\u003e paved over their civilization.  The receding glaciers have turned into a\n\u003e bit of an archaeological treasure chest, as they expose artifacts buried\n\u003e in and underneath them as they shrink that have been preserved by the\n\u003e ice for thousands of years.  I don\u0027t see any compelling reason to \"save\n\u003e the glaciers\" anyway, particularly in light of the fact that their\n\u003e existence has always been transient.\n\nMost global climate change scientists would agree that temperatures in the\npast have often been much warmer than today. The point of global warming\nisn\u0027t to save the Earth -- the planet is not sentient. The point is to\nunderstand and potentially reduce the impact of increasing temperatures on\nglobal human activity.\n\n\u003e For anyone to insist that the current negligible fluctuations are\n\u003e anthropogenic just heaps one ridiculous assertion upon another.  I\u0027ll\n\u003e just stick with Occam\u0027s Razor for now.\n\nThe increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration is due to human activity.\n\nIt is generally accepted that increases in CO2 in a closed environment\nsubject to solar heating retain more of that solar energy. This is the\ncurrent best explanation for the high temperature of Venus. If the CO2\nconcentration goes up globally (which it has), then theory states the earth\nshould be retaining greater solar energy. This process may be slow, and may\nbe difficult to monitor due to the variability of temperatures worldwide. I\nencourage you to refute any part of this causal chain linking CO2 to\neventual increases in global energy content, part of which will be evident\nas heat.\n\n- Jim\n\n",

Signal not noise.\n\nI\u0027ll start:\n\n\n              Los Angeles Times September 23, 2002 Monday\n                   Copyright 2002 / Los Angeles Times\n                            Los Angeles Times\n\nSeptember 23, 2002 Monday  Home Edition\nSECTION: Main News Main News; Part 1; Page 13; National Desk\nLENGTH: 1013 words\nBYLINE: DANA CALVO, TIMES STAFF WRITER\nDATELINE: SEATTLE\n\nBODY:\n\nThe idea came at the end of a long, frustrating brown-bag session at a\npublic-policy think tank here.\n\nThe challenge was to save the city\u0027s child-care programs. Staring into\nhis empty coffee cup, the meeting coordinator\u0027s mind landed on an\nunlikely solution: Put a tax--just a \"benign\" dime a shot--on\nespresso.\n\nThat led to a petition signed by more than 20,000 Seattle residents,\nand next year, voters will decide whether the tax becomes law, one\nthat taps right into Seattle\u0027s legendary addiction to coffee. This is,\nafter all, the town where Starbucks was born and where the $12 pound\nof beans became a staple. There is one Starbucks for every 7,000\nresidents in Seattle, compared to one per 64,000 in New York. Seattle\nalso has two other major coffee chains, Tully\u0027s Coffee and Seattle\u0027s\nBest Coffee, as well as countless cafes and espresso carts.\n\nA recent poll showed that 74% of Seattle residents would vote for the\ntax. \"For people outside of Seattle who don\u0027t understand the\nconsumption of espresso, [the tax proposal] can be seen as crazy,\"\nsaid John Burbank, the think tank\u0027s executive director, \"but it was\ncommon sense.\"\n\nResearch by his nonprofit Economic Opportunity Institute showed that\npeople preferred a tax on liquor or beer over one on espresso. But\nbecause of the large number of lattes and cappuccinos sold, a tax on\nespresso could be lower than one levied on alcohol.\n\nBurbank estimates the tax could generate $7 million to $10 million a\nyear. City Council aides dispute his figures, saying their research\nshows the tax would bring in $1.5 million to $3 million a year.\n\nBurbank\u0027s institute is funded by foundations and labor unions. The\nthink tank\u0027s mission is to promote public policy in the interests of\nlow-income people, and it has long championed child-care issues.\n\nBurbank says the tax would restore cuts to the child-care programs\nmade earlier this year by Gov. Gary Locke. He also says it would\nprovide more low-income families with subsidies for child care,\nimprove preschool programs and increase teacher salaries.\n\nAt Bauhaus Books \u0026 Coffee, the sidewalk is dotted with tables of\ncustomers for whom coffee is a half-day activity, not just a drink.\n\nEspresso lovers like Chris Altman, who at a dime a day would spend an\nextra $36.50 a year, said the investment is worth it. \"I\u0027m OK with\nit,\" said the 35-year-old, stirring his iced latte. \"The money\u0027s got\nto come from somewhere.\"\n\nHope Revuelto, 25, was cooling her regular coffee ($1 because she\nbrought her own mug) and reading \"Zen and the Art of Pottery.\" She\nsupports the initiative and said its critics are behaving as would be\nexpected of espresso drinkers: They want the most expensive thing on\nthe menu but resist paying 10 cents to help the needy.\n\nSome say the tax isn\u0027t the issue; they just resent being singled out.\n\nDavid Marsh, 45, a costume manager, drinks up to three espressos a\nday, which means he\u0027d be shelling out an extra $109.50 a year. \"I, for\none, don\u0027t have kids, but I drink espresso,\" he said, as he sewed a\nleather collar onto a chain-mail tunic. \"I don\u0027t mind paying, but I\nthink everyone should pay.\"\n\nCoffeehouses are steamed about it, and they\u0027ve organized as\nJOLT--Joined to Oppose the Latte Tax. Among the members are Seattle\u0027s\nChamber of Commerce and the city\u0027s two largest coffee franchises,\nStarbucks and Tully\u0027s.\n\nThe tax would force coffeehouses to track sales of any beverage that\ncontains espresso, a task that could be an administrative nightmare\nfor smaller cafes, especially during the frantic morning rush. If\nespresso counts come under suspicion, coffeehouse owners could face a\ncity audit.\n\nUniversity of Chicago economics professor Michael Greenstone said the tax doesn\u0027t add up. \n\n\"The purpose of any tax is to be efficient and equitable, and this is\nneither,\" he said. \"On the efficiency side, it\u0027s surely going to lead\nto costly efforts by both businesses and consumers to find ways to\navoid the tax. For example, Starbucks could claim that they are using\nfinely ground coffee, [instead of coffee run though an espresso maker]\nand that consequently, they are exempt from the tax. Would they be\nright? I don\u0027t know, but finding out will surely take lots of legal\nfees that could have gone to child care.\n\n\"Of course, from a public-relations perspective, this is an ingenious\nidea, and I mean that in a cynical way. They\u0027ve pitted espresso\ndrinkers against child-care supporters, and who\u0027s going to side with\nthe espresso drinkers?\"\n\nIn fact, the proposed tax has forced opponents into a political\ntwo-step, where their criticism must remain a beat behind their public\nstance of political correctness. In a liberal city like Seattle,\ncorporations continually advertise their commitment to social\nactivism, and throughout the debate over the initiative, JOLT members\nprefaced their opposition with endorsements of good child care.\n\n\"Starbucks will continue to support early-learning and\nchildhood-development programs through the millions of dollars we\ncontribute annually,\" the company said. \"However, Starbucks does not\nunderstand why the Economic Opportunity Institute would recommend an\nadditional consumer tax on espresso beverages, or any other single\nconsumer product.\"\n\nThe City Council has yet to decide when the initiative will go before\nvoters next year. The initiative\u0027s authors say it is directed at\nvendors; critics predict it will be passed on to consumers through\nhigher prices, effectively punishing them for their choice of coffee.\nThe tax would be applied to any drink with at least half an ounce of\nespresso, including decaf. Drip coffee would be exempt.\n\nBurbank says the tax would reach only a pre-selected group of\nconsumers who are wealthier than those who drink drip. So, he\u0027s been\npitching it as a modern-day Robin Hood tax, where the needy get a dime\nevery time the affluent spend $3 to $4 on an espresso.\n\nIt\u0027s the kind of political marketing that Fran Beulah, 43, finds\nfunny. \"I drink espresso,\" she said, laughing, \"and I am not rich.\"\n\n\n\n\nJH\u003e \"I did not have sex with that woman.\"\n\n\u003e\u003e -----Original Message-----\n\u003e\u003e From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of\nJH\u003e Mr.\n\u003e\u003e FoRK\n\u003e\u003e Sent: Monday, September 23, 2002 2:12 PM\n\u003e\u003e To: FoRK\n\u003e\u003e Subject: Re: Goodbye Global Warming\n\u003e\u003e \n\u003e\u003e \n\u003e\u003e ----- Original Message -----\n\u003e\u003e From: \"John Hall\" \u003cjohnhall@evergo.net\u003e\n\u003e\u003e \n\u003e\u003e \u003e A Green once said that if the Spotted Owl hadn\u0027t existed they\n\u003e\u003e \u003e would have had to invent it.\n\u003e\u003e A Republican once said \"I am not a crook\".\n\n\n\n\n\n-- \nBest regards,\n bitbitch                            mailto:bitbitch@magnesium.net\n\n",

I knew you could...\n\n[Given that an undergraduate liberal arts degree from a state school,\nlike, say, mine, :-), is nothing but stuff they should have taught\nyou in a government-run \"high\" school, you\u0027ll probably get more of\n*those* on the Forbes 400 as well as time goes on. If we ever get\naround to having a good old fashioned government-collapsing\ntransfer-payment depression (an economic version of this summer\u0027s\ngovernment-forest conflagration, caused by the same kind of\ninnumeracy that not clear-cutting enough forests did out west this\nsummer :-)) that should motivate more than a few erst-slackers out\nthere, including me, :-), to learn to actually feed themselves.]\n\n\nThe *next* category on the Forbes 400 list is someone with a\n\"terminal\" professional degree, like an MBA, PhD, MD, etc., from the\nbest school possible.\n\nWhy? Because, as of about 1950, the *best* way to get into Harvard,\nfor instance, is to be *smart*, not rich. Don\u0027t take my word for it,\nask their admissions office. Look at the admissions stats over the\nyears for proof.\n\nMeritocracy, American Style, was *invented* at the Ivy League after\nWorld War II.

Practically *nobody* who\ngoes to a top-20 American institution of higher learning can actually\nafford to go there these days. Unless, of course, their parents, who\ncouldn\u0027t afford to go there themselves, got terminal degrees in the\nlast 40 years or so. And their kids *still* had to get the grades,\nand \"biased\" (by intelligence :-)), test scores, to get in.\n\n\nThe bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with \"terminal\"\ndegrees, until they actually *own* something and *hire* people, or\nlearn to *make* something for a living all day on a profit and loss\nbasis, persist in the practically insane belief, like life after\ndeath, that economics is some kind of zero sum game, that dumb people\nwho don\u0027t work hard for it make all the money, and, if someone *is*\nsmart, works hard, and is rich, then they stole their wealth somehow.\n\nBTW, none of you guys out there holding the short end of this\nrhetorical stick can blame *me* for the fact that I\u0027m using it to\nbeat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders. You\nwere, apparently, too dumb to grab the right end. *I* went to\nMissouri, and *I* don\u0027t have a degree in anything actually useful,\nmuch less a \"terminal\" one, which means *I*\u0027m broker than anyone on\nthis list -- it\u0027s just that *you*, of all people, lots with\neducations far surpassing my own, should just plain know better.

In addition,\nmost of the people who *inherited* money on the list would have\n*much* less of it, not even relatively speaking. Finally, practically\nall of that \"new\" money would have come from economic efficiency and\nnot \"stolen\" from someone else, investment bubbles or not.\n\nThat efficiency is called \"progress\", for those of you in The\nPeople\u0027s Republics of Berkeley or Cambridge.

But -- and this is\na huge one -- you don\u0027t necessarily find it on the Forbes list.  There\nis an element of LUCK, even if only being in the right place at the\nright time, to go that high.\n\nBeyond the Forbes List, there are many ways in which almost pure LUCK is\ninvolved in significant wealth.  Being a super-model, for example.\nThough I think most people would be surprised by a lot of super-models.\nCindy Crawford was valedictorian of her high school.\n\nMost people, of course, aren\u0027t in those stratified realms.  It is the\nrest of us who tend to sort.\n\nThere is a huge philosophical problem with the concept of Merit in the\nfirst place.  Rawls claims Merit doesn\u0027t exist.  Sowell seems to agree\nat least in part, but I\u0027m sure Sowell would also state that the benefits\nof pretending it exists for society at large are enormous.\n\nAnd if Merit does exist then exactly what is it measuring?  IQ?  Purity\nof heart?  Or the ability to satisfy customers?  Functionally most\npeople seem to equate Merit with IQ though they say it would be better\nif it were purity of heart.  Yet the type of Merit that lands you on the\nForbes list, or even just being a garden variety \u0027millionaire next door\u0027\nis more likely to be the \u0027serving customers\u0027 definition.\n\nDifferences due to merit, when they are perceived as such, generate far\nmore animosity than differences due to luck.  Luck can be forgiven.\nSuperior performance, often not.\n\n\n\u003e -----Original Message-----\n\u003e From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of\nGeege\n\u003e Schuman\n\u003e Sent: Monday, September 23, 2002 4:44 PM\n\u003e To: R.

But the energy\nindustry failed the smell test in 2000 and 2001 as it tried to justify\nsoaring wholesale electricity and natural-gas prices in California.\n\nNow, as investigators and regulators unravel the reasons for a financial\nand fiscal mess we\u0027ll be cleaning up for decades, we\u0027re learning what\neveryone suspected. Market games helped engineer the price spikes.\n\nThe latest manipulation was highlighted in Monday\u0027s finding by a federal\nadministrative law judge, who said a dominant natural-gas company squeezed\nsupplies in order to squeeze customers. His ruling came a few days after\nCalifornia\u0027s Public Utilities Commission reported that electricity\ngenerators mysteriously failed to use available capacity during the crunch,\nalso driving up prices.\n\nAnd don\u0027t forget the sleazy games by energy traders who gleefully worked\nthe system, in schemes best summed up by an Enron insider\u0027s boast in a\nmemorandum made public in May, that ``Enron gets paid for moving energy to\nrelieve congestion without actually moving any energy or relieving any\ncongestion.\u0027\u0027\n\nHow much of this was illegal, as opposed to simply amoral, remains to be\nseen. Unfortunately, California\u0027s response -- confusion, lawsuits and\npolicy tweaks -- hasn\u0027t been sufficient.\n\nMore unfortunately, even if the state suddenly did all the right things --\nincluding a hard-nosed program designed to free ourselves from the gougers\u0027\ngrips -- we would need a willing federal partner. But it\u0027s foolish to think\nthat the Bush administration would do much to help one of its least\nfavorite states, or do anything that conflicts with its love of\ntraditional, non-renewable energy sources.\n\nIf the lawsuits against various energy companies and traders bear any\nfruit, the best we can expect is to pay off some of the massive debts the\nstate amassed to prevent a total collapse in early 2001. That\u0027s a\nreasonable approach, but don\u0027t expect miracles.\n\nState policies are moving the wrong way on utility regulation, meanwhile.\nInstead of relentlessly pursuing smart deregulation -- still a good idea if\nit gives customers genuine choices -- state laws and regulations ``put the\nutilities back in the business of buying energy for captive customers,\u0027\u0027\nnotes V. John White, executive director of the Sacramento-based Center for\nEnergy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies (www.ceert.org).\n\nIt\u0027s tempting to call for an outright state takeover of the utilities --\ntempting but a bad idea. When there\u0027s genuine competition, as we could\nachieve in electricity generation, the private sector tends to do a better\njob. Instead of abandoning deregulation, California should find a way to\ninject real competition into the market.\n\nWe do need to recognize that the current system of delivering electricity\ndefies privatization, at least under current conditions. Smart regulation\nis essential.\n\nBut the best response to gouging is to use less of what the gougers\ncontrol. There are two ways: conservation and replacement. We need more of\nboth.\n\nThe best recent step is a new state law that slowly but surely ratchets up\nthe use of electricity from renewables. By 2017, California\u0027s utilities\nwill have to get 20 percent of their power from solar and other renewable\nsources. Several power companies are expected to do this even sooner.\n\nBut this law has an element of old-line thinking, the captive-customer\nmodel we need to be getting away from, not sustaining. Lip service to newer\nideas isn\u0027t enough.\n\nThe state should be removing barriers to micro-generation systems, small\ngenerators that can run on a variety of fuels and provide decentralized,\nharder-to-disrupt electricity to homes and businesses. This technology is\ncoming along fast. State policies are not keeping pace.\n\nInvesting to save energy is increasingly the smartest move of all.\nCalifornia should be doing more to encourage this, whether through tax\nincentives or outright grants in low-income households. California hasn\u0027t\ndone badly on conservation in a general sense, and energy customers did\nreact to last year\u0027s soaring rates and blackouts by cutting back, but it\u0027s\nlunacy to wait for the next crisis when we can do something to avoid it\naltogether.\n\nMaybe this is all pointless. The Bush administration\u0027s energy policies, so\ngrossly tilted toward the unholy trinity of oil, coal and nuclear, are\nmaking us all more vulnerable. Never mind what might happen if the coming\nwar in Iraq goes badly.\n\nIt\u0027s pointless to hope for a sane federal policy -- a crash program to\ndrastically speed the inevitable transition to a hydrogen-based energy\nsystem. But the largest state, one of the world\u0027s major economies in its\nown right, does have some clout. We can hit the rip-off artists where it\nhurts, and protect ourselves from even more serious disruptions. Maybe next\nyear.\n\n-- \n-----------------\nR. A.

    "message": "\nOK, let\u0027s bring some data into the discussion:\nhttp://www.grida.no/climate/vital/02.htm\n(A graph, derived from Vostok ice core samples, of CO2 and temperature\nfluctuations over the past 400k years).\n\n\u003e Recent high-resolution studies of historical CO2 concentrations and\n\u003e temperatures over hundreds of thousands of years have shown a modest\n\u003e correlation between the two. In a number of cases, CO2 level increases\n\u003e are not in phase with temperature increases and actually trail the\n\u003e increase in temperature by a short time i.e. increases in temperature\n\u003e preceded increases in CO2 concentrations. The more studies that are done\n\u003e of the geological record, the more it seems that CO2 concentrations are\n\u003e correlated with temperature increases, but are not significantly\n\u003e causative.\n\nBased on the Vostok data, you are right, there is a very strong correlation\nbetween temperature and CO2 concentrations, but it doesn\u0027t always appear to\nbe causal.\n\n\u003e With respect to absolute CO2 concentrations, it is also important to\n\u003e point out that our best data to date suggests that they follow a fairly\n\u003e regular cycle with a period of about 100,000 years.\n\nAlso correct -- the peak of each cycle is at about 290-300 ppm CO2.\n\n\u003e As it\n\u003e happens, current CO2 concentrations are within 10% of other previous\n\u003e cyclical concentration peaks for which we have good data.\n\nNot correct. Mauna Loa data \u003chttp://www.grida.no/climate/vital/06.htm\u003e and\n\u003chttp://cdiac.ornl.gov/ftp/ndp001/maunaloa.co2\u003e show that the current CO2\nconcentrations are at 370ppm, 18% *greater* than the *highest* recorded\nvalue from the past 400k years. Furthermore, CO2 concentrations are growing\nat 15ppm every 10 years, much faster than any recorded increase in the\nVostok data (though perhaps the Vostok data isn\u0027t capable of such fine\nresolution).\n\n\u003e In other words, we may be adding to the CO2 levels,\n\nNo, we are *definitely* adding to CO2 levels. Look at the following chart:\nhttp://www.grida.no/climate/vital/07.htm\n(Shows CO2 concentrations since 1870, the \"historical record\").\n\nNot only is the CO2 increase over 130 years unprecedented in the Vostok\nrecord, it is clear that the rate of change is *increasing*, not decreasing.\nThere is no other compelling explanation for this increase, except for\nanthropogenic input. You\u0027re really out on the fringe if you\u0027re debating\nthis -- even global warming skeptics generally concede this point.\n\n\u003e but it looks a lot like we\n\u003e would be building a molehill on top of a mountain in the historical\n\u003e record.  At the very least, there is nothing anomalous about current CO2\n\u003e concentrations.\n\nWrong again. Current CO2 levels are currently unprecedented over the past\n400k years, unless there is some mechanism that allows CO2 levels to quickly\nspike, and then return back to \"normal\" background levels (and hence the\nspike might not show up in the ice cores).\n\nStill, by around 2075-2100 we will have reached 500 ppm CO2, a level that\neven you would have a hard time arguing away.\n\n\u003e Also, CO2 levels interact with the biosphere in a manner that ultimately\n\u003e affects temperature.  Again, the interaction is not entirely\n\u003e predictable, but this is believed to be one of the regulating negative\n\u003e feedback systems mentioned above.\n\nYes, clouds and oceans are a big unknown. Still, we know ocean water has a\nfinite capacity to store CO2, and if the world temperature doesn\u0027t increase,\nbut we all have Seattle-like weather all the time, the effects would be\nenormous.\n\n\u003e Last, as greenhouse gases go, CO2 isn\u0027t particularly potent, although it\n\u003e makes up for it in volume in some cases.  Gases such as water and\n\u003e methane have a far greater impact as greenhouse gases on a per molecule\n\u003e basis.  Water vapor may actually be the key greenhouse gas, something\n\u003e that CO2 only indirectly effects through its interaction with the\n\u003e biosphere.\n\nCorrect.\n\nData on relative contributions of greenhouse gasses:\nhttp://www.grida.no/climate/vital/05.htm\n\nNote that methane concentrations now are *much* higher than pre-industrial\nlevels (many cows farting, and rice paddies outgassing), and methane is also\na contributor in the formation of atmospheric water vapor. Another clearly\nanthropogenic increase in a greenhouse gas. I\u0027m in favor of reductions in\nmethane levels as well.\n\nData on water vapor here:\nhttp://www.agu.org/sci_soc/mockler.html\n\n\u003e CO2 was an easy mark for early environmentalism, but all the recent\n\u003e studies and data I\u0027ve seen gives me the impression that it is largely a\n\u003e passenger on the climate ride rather than the driver.\n\nI tend to think that holistic, and techical approaches would work best in\nreducing global warming. I favor an energy policy that has a mix of solar,\nwind and nuclear, with all carbon-based combustion using renewable sources\nof C-H bonds. Aggressive pursuit of carbon sink strategies also makes sense\n(burying trees deep underground, for example). Approaches that involve\nreductions in lifestyle to a \"sustainable\" level are unrealistic --\nAmericans just won\u0027t do it (you\u0027d be surprised at the number of climate\nchange researchers driving SUVs). But, as California showed during last\nyear\u0027s energy crisis, shifts in patterns of consumption are possible, and\nimproved efficiency is an easy sell.\n\n- Jim\n\n",

Then we\n  go Rambo.\n\nHe has tactfully left out the hard\nrealists*; as for the rest I gather\nwilsonians play the idealists, and\nhamiltonians act where values and\ninterests intersect, and jacksonians \nact only when values and interests\noverlap.\n\nKissinger himself seems to be a\nHamiltonian; much of the book is\nabout how he thinks we ought to\nbe shaping the balance of power\nin various foreign regions.\n\nMaybe I\u0027ve been too affected by\nKant, but I can\u0027t see that such\na strategy works unless one can\ncount on a Bismarck runnning it:\nhow lopsided does the US look if\neveryone tries to run a balance\nof power politics?\n\n- -Dave\n\n*\n\u003e The road to empire leads to domestic decay because, in time, the claims\n\u003e of omnipotence erode domestic restraints.  No empire has avoided the\n\u003e road to Caesarism unless, like the British Empire, it devolved its\n\u003e power before this process could develop.  In long-lasting empires,\n\u003e every problem turns into a domestic issue [which should be handled\n\u003e very differently from international ones] because the outside world\n\u003e no longer provides a counterweight.  And as challenges grow more\n\u003e diffuse and increasingly remote from the historic domestic base,\n\u003e internal struggles become ever more bitter and in time violent.\n\u003e A deliberate quest for hegemony is the surest way to destroy the\n\u003e values that made the United States great.\n\nKings and tyrants generically have\nfollowed the same power politics:\ngarner popular support by keeping\npotential oligarchs down.  In other\ntraditions, a king is a legitimate\ntyrant, and a tyrant an illegitimate\nking.  In the US, I\u0027d hope that we,\nlike Samuel, wouldn\u0027t naturally make\nsuch fine distinctions.\n\n",

    "message": "\n\nI wanted to get back to this but didn\u0027t have the time.  I actually lived on\na couple different Indian reservations growing up in the Pacific Northwest\nand also spent a fair amount time in Lakota/Sioux country as well.  And my\nparents have lived on an even more diverse range of Indian reservations than\nI have (my experience being a direct result of living with my parents).  I\ndo get a lot of my information first-hand, or in some cases, second-hand\nfrom my father.\n\nThe income figures for the Indians are somewhat misleading, mostly because\nit is really hard to do proper accounting of the effective income.  While it\nis true that some Indians live in genuine poverty, it is typically as a\nconsequence of previous poor decisions that were made by the tribe, not\nsomething that was impressed upon them.\n\nThe primary problem with the accounting is that there is a tribal entity\nthat exists separately from the individuals, typically an \"Indian\nCorporation\" of one type or another where each member of the tribe owns a\nsingle share (the details of when and how a share becomes active varies from\ntribe to tribe).  In most tribes, a dividend is paid out to each of the\ntribal members from the corporation, usually to the tune of $10-30k per\nuser, depending on the tribe.  The dividend money comes from a number of\nplaces, with the primary sources being the Federal Gov\u0027t and various\nbusinesses/assets owned by the Indian corporation.\n\nYou have to understand a couple things:  First, a great many Indian tribes\nare run as purely communist enterprises.  Everyone gets a check for their\nshare no matter what.  One of the biggest problems this has caused is very\nhigh unemployment (often 70-90%) for tribal members, who are more than happy\ntake their dividend and not work.  The dividend they receive from the\ncorporation often constitutes their sole \"income\" for government accounting\npurposes.  Unfortunately, to support this type of economics when no one\nworks, they\u0027ve had to sell off most of their useful assets to maintain those\ndividends.  Many of the tribes genuinely living in poverty do so because\nthey have run out of things to sell yet nobody works.  One of the ironies is\nthat on many of the reservations where the tribes still have assets to burn,\nmany of the people working in the stores and such are actually poor white\nfolk, not Indians.\n\nSecond, even though the tribe members each get a cash dividend, they also\nreceive an enormous range of benefits and perks from the Indian corporation\nto the tune of tens of thousands of dollars per user annually.  By\nbenefits and perks, we are talking about the kinds of things no other\nordinary American receives from either their employer or the government.\n\nIt should be pointed out that while many of these Indian corporations are\nineptly run, and mostly provide sinecures for other Indians, a minority are\nvery smartly managed and a few hire non-Indian business executives with good\ncredentials to run their business divisions.  An example of this is the\nHaida Corporation, which while having less 1,000 tribal shareholders, has\nbillions of dollars in assets and the various corporations they own have\ngross revenues in the $200-300 million range (and growing).  Yet the\ndividend paid out is strictly controlled, about $20k in this particular\ncase, and they engaged in a practice of waiting a couple decades before\ndrawing money from any of the assets they were granted which has led to\nintelligent investment and use.  They don\u0027t eat their seed corn, and have\nactually managed to grow their stash.  In contrast, a couple islands over,\nthere is another tribe of ~2,000 people that has a net loss of about $50\nmillion annually IIRC while being regularly endowed by the Federal\ngovernment with several billions of dollars in valuable assets.  This\nparticular tribe has a modest income in theory, but the actual expenditures\nper user annually is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, and many\nborrow money against future income.  Incidentally, in this particular case,\nthe people that ARE working frequently pull in a few hundred thousand\ndollars a year, much of which goes back to the tribal corporation rather\nthan their own pockets.\n\nSomewhat annoying, the Federal government semi-regularly grants valuable\nassets to these tribes when they\u0027ve burned through the ones previously given\nwhere feasible, typically selling the assets to American or foreign\ncompanies.  And the cycle continues.\n\nSo what is the primary problem for the tribes that have problems?  In a\nnutshell, a thoroughly pathological culture and society.\n\nFew women reach the age of 16 without getting pregnant.  Incest, rape, and\ngross promiscuity is rampant.  Inbreeding, heavy drug abuse during\npregnancy, and other environmental factors have created tribes where a very\nsubstantial fraction of the tribe is literally mentally retarded.  Many of\nthe thoughtful and intelligent tribe members leave the reservation at the\nearliest opportunity, mostly to avoid the problems mentioned above.  On one\nreservation my parents lived, the HIV infection rate was \u003e70%.  Many of\nthese societies are thoroughly corrupt, and the administration of the law is\narbitrary and capricious (they do have their own judges, courts, police\netc).\n\nIn short, many of these tribes that are still hanging together are in a\nshambles because they have become THE most pathological societies that I\nhave ever seen anywhere.  Because of their legal status, there really aren\u0027t\nthat many consequences for their behavior.  There are many things that I\ncould tell you that I\u0027ve seen that you probably would not believe unless\nyou\u0027d seen it yourself.  There are always good people in these tribes, but\nit has gotten to the point where the losers and idiots outnumber the good\nguys by a fair margin many times, and this IS a mobocracy typically.  (BTW,\nif any of you white folk wants to experience overt and aggressive racism as\na minority in a place where the rule of law is fiction and the police are\nopenly thugs, try living on one of these messed up Indian reservations.  It\nwill give you an interesting perspective on things.)\n\nThere are only two real situations where you find reasonably prosperous\nIndians.  The first is in the rare case of tribes run by disciplined and\nintelligent people that have managed their assets wisely.  The second is\nwhere the tribe has dispersed and assimilated for the most part, even if\nthey maintain their tribal identity.  In both of these cases, the tribal\nleaders reject the insular behavior that tends to lead to the pathological\ncases mentioned above.\n\nThe Indians are often quite wealthy technically, and a lot of money is spent\nby the tribe per capita.  And the actual reportable income is quite high\nwhen you consider how many are living entirely off the tribal dole.  It is\njust that their peculiar economic structure does not lend itself well to\nordinary economic analysis by merely looking at their nominal income.  The\npoverty is social and cultural in nature, not economic.  This was my\noriginal point.\n\n\nOn a tangent:\n\nOne thing that has always interested me is the concept of quasi-tribal\ncorporate socialism.  Many Indian tribes implement a type of corporate\nsocialism that is mind-bogglingly bad in execution.  That they use this\nstructure at all is an accident of history more than anything.  But what has\ninterested me is that the very smartly managed ones do surprisingly well\nover the long run.  It is like a Family Corporation writ large.\n\nIt seems that in a future where \"familial\" ties will be increasingly\nvoluntary, the general concept may have some merit in general Western\nsociety, serving to create a facsimile of a biological extended family with\nthe included dynamics, but with an arbitrary set of self-selecting\nindividuals.\n\nDamn that was long (and its late), and it could have been a lot longer.\n\n-James Rogers\n jamesr@best.com \n\n\n\nOn 9/22/02 3:53 PM, \"John Hall\" \u003cjohnhall@evergo.net\u003e wrote:\n\u003e \n\u003e As I understand it, there is a huge difference between native Americans\n\u003e who speak english at home and those who do not.

Private money paid for these bits, but expropriation may be fairer for IP than real-P.\n\nRohit\n\nkhare@alumni.caltech.edu\n\n\nVast Detail on Towers\u0027 Collapse May Be Sealed\n\nSeptember 30, 2002\nBy JAMES GLANZ and ERIC LIPTON \n\n\n\n\n \n\nWhat is almost certainly the most sophisticated and\ncomplete understanding of exactly how and why the twin\ntowers of the World Trade Center fell has been compiled as\npart of a largely secret proceeding in federal court in\nLower Manhattan. \n\nAmassed during the initial stages of a complicated\ninsurance lawsuit involving the trade center, the\nconfidential material contains data and expert analysis\ndeveloped by some of the nation\u0027s most respected\nengineering minds. It includes computer calculations that\nhave produced a series of three-dimensional images of the\ncrumpled insides of the towers after the planes hit,\nhelping to identify the sequence of failures that led to\nthe collapses. \n\nAn immense body of documentary evidence, like maps of the\ndebris piles, rare photos and videos, has also been\naccumulated in a collection that far outstrips what\ngovernment analysts have been able to put together as they\nstruggle to answer the scientifically complex and\nemotionally charged questions surrounding the deadly\nfailures of the buildings. \n\nBut everyone from structural engineers to relatives of\nvictims fear that the closely held information, which\nincludes the analysis and the possible answers that\nfamilies and engineers around the world have craved, may\nremain buried in sealed files, or even destroyed. \n\nBound by confidentiality agreements with their clients, the\nexperts cannot disclose their findings publicly as they\nwait for the case to play out. Such restrictions are\ntypical during the discovery phase of litigation. And as it\nnow stands, the judge in the case - who has agreed that\ncertain material can remain secret for the time being - has\napproved standard legal arrangements that, should the\nlawsuit be settled before trial, could cause crucial\nmaterial generated by the competing sides to be withheld. \n\n\"We\u0027re obviously in favor of releasing the information, but\nwe can\u0027t until we\u0027re told what to do,\" said Matthys Levy,\nan engineer and founding partner at Weidlinger Associates,\nwho is a consultant in the case and the author of \"Why\nBuildings Fall Down: How Structures Fail\" (Norton, 2nd\nedition, 2002). \n\n\"Let\u0027s just say we understand the mechanics of the whole\nprocess\" of the collapse, Mr. Levy said. \n\nMonica Gabrielle, who lost her husband, Richard, when the\nsouth tower fell and who is a member of the Skyscraper\nSafety Campaign, said the information should be disclosed.\n\"If they have answers and are not going to share them, I\nwould be devastated,\" Mrs. Gabrielle said. \"They have a\nmoral obligation.\" \n\nThe lawsuit that has generated the information involves\nLarry A. Silverstein, whose companies own a lease on the\ntrade center property, and a consortium of insurance\ncompanies. Mr. Silverstein maintains that each jetliner\nthat hit the towers constituted a separate terrorist\nattack, entitling him to some $7 billion, rather than half\nthat amount, as the insurance companies say. \n\nAs both sides have prepared their arguments, they have\nspent hundreds of thousands of dollars acquiring expert\nopinion about exactly what happened to the towers. \n\nDean Davison, a spokesman for Industrial Risk Insurers of\nHartford, one of the insurance companies in the suit, said\nof the findings, \"There are some confidentiality agreements\nthat are keeping those out of the public domain today.\" He\nconceded that differing opinions among the more than 20\ninsurers on his side of the case could complicate any\nrelease of the material. \n\nAs for his own company, whose consultants alone have\nproduced more than 1,700 pages of analysis and thousands of\ndiagrams and photographs, Mr. Davison said every attempt\nwould be made to give the material eventually to \"public\nauthorities and investigative teams.\" \n\nStill, some of that analysis relies on information like\nblueprints and building records from other sources, like\nthe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which built\nand owned the trade center and supports Mr. Silverstein in\nthe suit. Mr. Davison said he was uncertain how the\ndiffering origins of the material would influence his\ncompany\u0027s ability to release information. \n\nIn a statement, the Port Authority said access to documents\nwould be \"decided on a case-by-case basis consistent with\napplicable law and policy,\" adding that it would cooperate\nwith \"federal investigations.\" \n\nThe fate of the research is particularly critical to\nresolve unanswered questions about why the towers fell,\ngiven the dissatisfaction with the first major inquiry into\nthe buildings\u0027 collapse. That investigation, led by the\nFederal Emergency Management Agency, was plagued by few\nresources, a lack of access to crucial information like\nbuilding plans, and infighting among experts and officials.\nA new federal investigation intended to remedy those\nfailings has just begun at the National Institute of\nStandards and Technology, or NIST, an agency that has\nstudied many building disasters. \n\nOfficials with NIST have said it could take years to make\nfinal determinations and recommendations for other\nbuildings, a process they now acknowledge might be speeded\nup with access to the analysis done by the consultants on\nthe lawsuit. \n\nGerald McKelvey, a spokesman for Mr. Silverstein, said of\nthe real estate executive\u0027s own heavily financed\ninvestigative work, \"We decline to comment other than to\nsay that Silverstein is cooperating fully with the NIST\ninvestigation.\" A spokesman for the agency confirmed it was\nin discussions with Mr. Silverstein on the material, but\nsaid no transfer had taken place. \n\nWith no shortage of money or expertise, investigations by\nboth sides in the legal case have produced a startling body\nof science and theory, some of it relevant not only to the\ntrade center disaster but to other skyscrapers as well. \n\n\"The work should be available to other investigators,\" said\nRamon Gilsanz, a structural engineer and managing partner\nat Gilsanz Murray Steficek, who was a member of the earlier\ninquiry. \"It could be used to build better buildings in the\nfuture.\" \n\nLegal experts say confidentiality arrangements like the one\ngoverning the material can lead to a variety of outcomes,\nfrom full or partial disclosure to destruction of such\ninformation. In some cases, litigants who paid for the\nreports may make them public themselves. Or they may ask to\nhave them sealed forever. \n\"It is not unusual for one party or another to try to keep\nsome of those documents secret for one reason or another,\nsome legitimate, some not,\" said Lee Levine, a First\nAmendment lawyer at Levine Sullivan \u0026 Koch in Washington. \n\nMr. Levine said that because of the presumed value of the\ninformation, the court might look favorably on requests to\nmake it public. But the uncertainty over the fate of the\nmaterial is unnerving to many people, especially experts\nwho believe that only a complete review of the evidence -\nnot piecemeal disclosures by litigants eager to protect\ntheir own interests - could lead to an advance in the\nfederal investigation of the trade center. \n\n\"It\u0027s important for this to get presented and published and\nsubjected to some scrutiny,\" said Dr. John Osteraas,\ndirector of civil engineering practice at Exponent Failure\nAnalysis in Menlo Park, Calif., and a consultant on the\ncase, \"because then the general engineering community can\nsort it out.\" \n\nThe scope of the investigation behind the scenes is vast by\nany measure. Mr. Levy and his colleagues at Weidlinger\nAssociates, hired by Silverstein Properties, have called\nupon powerful computer programs, originally developed with\nthe Pentagon for classified research, to create a model of\nthe Sept. 11 attack from beginning to end. \n\nThe result is a compilation of three-dimensional images of\nthe severed exterior columns, smashed floor and damaged\ncore of the towers, beginning with the impacts and\nproceeding up to the moments of collapse. Those images -\nwhich Mr. Levy is not allowed to release - have helped\npinpoint the structural failures. \n\nThe FEMA investigators did not have access to such computer\nmodeling. Nor did the FEMA team have unfettered access to\nthe trade center site, with all its evidence, in the weeks\nimmediately after the attacks. But no such constraints\nhampered engineers at LZA/Thornton-Tomasetti, brought to\nthe site for emergency work beginning on the afternoon of\nSept. 11. Daniel A. Cuoco, the company president and a\nconsultant to Silverstein Properties on the case, said he\nhad assembled detailed maps of the blazing debris at ground\nzero in models that perhaps contain further clues about how\nthe towers fell. \n\nThough the FEMA team could not determine \"where things\nactually fell,\" Mr. Cuoco said, \"we\u0027ve indicated the\nspecific locations.\" \n\nMr. Cuoco said he could not reveal any additional details\nof the findings. Nor would Mr. Osteraas discuss the details\nof computer calculations his company has done on the spread\nof fires in large buildings like the twin towers. Mr.\nOsteraas has also compiled an extensive archive of\nphotographs and videos of the towers that day, some of\nwhich he believes have not been available to other\ninvestigators. \n\nAnd the investigation has not limited itself to computers\nand documentary evidence. For months, experiments in wind\ntunnels in the United States and Canada have been examining\nthe aerodynamics that fed the flames that day and stressed\nthe weakening structures. \n\nJack Cermak, president of Cermak Peterka Peterson in Fort\nCollins, Colo., was retained by the insurance companies but\nhad previously performed wind-tunnel studies for the\noriginal design of the twin towers nearly 40 years ago. For\nthe legal case, Dr. Cermak said, \"we\u0027ve done probably more\ndetailed measurements than in the original design.\" \n\n\"The data that have been acquired are very valuable in\nthemselves for understanding how wind and buildings\ninteract,\" Dr. Cermak said. \"Some of the information may be\nvaluable for the litigation,\" he said, adding, \"I think\nI\u0027ve told you all I can.\"\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/30/nyregion/30TOWE.html?ex\u003d1034388663\u0026ei\u003d1\u0026en\u003d0d3143a997e5e2e1\n\n\n\nHOW TO ADVERTISE\n---------------------------------\nFor information on advertising in e-mail newsletters \nor other creative advertising opportunities with The \nNew York Times on the Web, please contact\nonlinesales@nytimes.com or visit our online media \nkit at http://www.nytimes.com/adinfo\n\nFor general information about NYTimes.com, write to \nhelp@nytimes.com.  \n\nCopyright 2002 The New York Times Company\n\n",

As it was posted to \"discussion\" I\nGAB\u003e thought there\u0027d be some.\n\nGAB\u003e Instead it\u0027s a Post-Gazette column by Brian O\u0027Neill\nGAB\u003e lamenting the fact that some people know how to\nGAB\u003e fill out a permit so that they can take advantage\nGAB\u003e of their right to peaceable assembly.  Obviously\nGAB\u003e he\u0027s poking fun at the idea that specific groups\nGAB\u003e get specific \"zones\" and that it\u0027s not up to the\nGAB\u003e police to decide what messages and signs get put into\nGAB\u003e what zones to most expediently keep order.  \n\nOh thats right Greg.  Because was explicitly clear that the pro-Bush\nfolks went out and did the permit dance.   So where in the article is\nthis again?\n\nLets get something straight here.   This -is- a First Amendment issue.\nPublic streets, provided one isn\u0027t blocking traffic, generally tend to\nbe sorta ok, at least from my last interpretation of Con Law a few\nyears ago (I\u0027ll feign ignorance wrt the fact that laws may have\nchanged, and the specific facts in this case are weak).    IF this guy\n_was_ merely holding a sign (which it seems was the case for all the\npro-bush folks) he did nothing wrong.  He certainly didn\u0027t do enough\nof a wrong to warrant a disorderly conduct charge.\n\nI\u0027ll play with your perspective though.   Lets assume a few things.\nIf I walk into the city office and tell them I want to peacably\nassemble against Bush, do you think they\u0027ll give me a permit?\nProbably not.   So I lie.   Then the cop does what happened in this\nscenario.  HE walks up, checks my permit and finds out that I\nfalsified my statement to get this said document.   He arrests me.\nEnd of story.\n\nGAB\u003e The problem is that politics have gotten so muddied\nGAB\u003e nowadays, that shouting down and unpeaceably disrupting\nGAB\u003e political rallies that you don\u0027t agree with has become\nGAB\u003e common practice.  The courts have constantly ruled\nGAB\u003e that there are some restrictions on the first amendment.\nGAB\u003e They teach you that your very first year of law school.\n\nI\u0027ll agree with Owen on this one.  Muddied my ass.  How hard is it to\nchose between a Republocrat or a Demipublican?   Not very.  Shouting\ndown has grown to become the answer because the government, over a\nspan of years, and with the help of the Courts -has- limited the\nrights we have as citizens under the First Amendment.    If you\nquestion the policy about terrorism, or drugs, or Iraq, or Bush in\ngeneral, you\u0027re aiding terrorism.   If you challenge the beliefs of\nthe folks attending the various shadowy G8 conferences, you\u0027re an\nanarchist, and you\u0027re herded off to a \u0027designated protest spot\u0027 miles\naway from anything.   Part of the point of speech is to be -heard-.\nI can scream on my soapbox in the forest somewhere, and while thats\nspeech, its not effective speech.  People are screaming and shouting\nover the political figures because they cannot be  heard in any other\nway.\n\n\n\n\nGAB\u003e I think that given the information as laid out by the story,\nGAB\u003e Mr. O\u0027Neill has confused free speech with action.  Free\nGAB\u003e speech or even protected speech as practiced by almost \nGAB\u003e every American seems to involve the ability to communicate\nGAB\u003e an idea to an unknown audience.

How do you communicate  an idea to\nan unknown audience, if you\u0027re miles from where the audience is?   How\ndo you bypass the rules for being -miles- away from the audience\nwithout violating the rules of the regime?  I don\u0027t think Mr. Nell was\nthrowing pies at Bush.  A sign, the last time I checked, didn\u0027t cause\nphysical injury, or even emotional harm.  If I remember Cohen v.\nCalifornia, 403 U.S. 15 (1971), its not the individual speaking that\nhas the requirement to desist, but the individual listening who has\nthe option to leave.\n\n\nJust my .02, while its still considered legal.\n\n\n\n\n-- \nBest regards,\n bitbitch                            mailto:bitbitch@magnesium.net\n\n",

(Which is the\ngross culmination of everyone\u0027s argument sofar)  The screaming isn\u0027t\nthe most effective method around.  I don\u0027t believe I argued that it\nwas.  But screaming is happening because the means to communicate to\nthe representatives involved are diminishing, at least as far as the\npeople doing the screaming are concerned.   For the record, I don\u0027t\nsupport the screamers in organized conferences (Such as the Colin\nPowell shout-down that was mentioned earlier).  I don\u0027t think that\nthis is what the 1st Amendment was implying.  These folks -do- have a\nright to be heard, and I think they have a right to be heard by the\nfolks they elected in the first place.\n\nMy point, (my only point) was really more concerned with the cases\nsuch as Mr. Nell.   He wasn\u0027t engaged (at least from the limited facts\nwe have) in a shoutout, but rather in a difference of opinion.   He\nhas a right to possess this opinion and make it known  to the\nrepresentatives that are elected.   A sign is not a shout-out.\n\nI think I may have missed (or not accurately addressed) the original\nthread switch that took this example and mixed in the screaming\ndissenters to the mix.  I was mostly responding with my miffedness in\nhaving broad-brush strokes applied to a group without examining the\npolicy reasons that might have contributed to it.   IN this case, the\nscreaming parties are fed up with getting corralled miles away from\nthe folks they need to speak with.   They\u0027re resorting to creative,\noffensive and constitutionally challengable means, but its not simply\ndue to the fact that they\u0027re 20 and have lost all decorum.   The \u0027My\ngeneration never did this \u0027 is all BS.   THere\u0027s more to this story,\nwe just dont\u0027 know it all.\n\nI hope this clarifies my position.   For the quick rehash:\n\nScreaming !\u003d Free speech on all cases.\nDissent \u003d Free speech, provided you follow what has been laid down by\nthe Supremes.\n\nK?\n\n-- \nBest regards,\n bitbitch                            mailto:bitbitch@magnesium.net\n\n",

    "message": "\nOne of the most bizarre pages I\u0027ve seen on the Web. At first I thought it\nmight be some sort of back-story to a RPG, but, nope, it looks like somebody\nbelieves this.\n\n\u003d\u003d\u003d\nhttp://www.viking-z.org/r20i.htm\n\nM09. Dinosaurs Eggs and the Origins of Good and Evil.\nDINOSAURS. Reptoid ETs are reported to be 12 foot high crocodiles walking on\ntheir hind legs. This is a description of a dinosaur. It now appears in\nRemote Viewing that the Reptoid ETs, dinosaurs and dragons are all linked\ntogether and that they all originated on Earth. The Erideans who are Reptoid\nderivatives have a home planet (in the Eridanus system) like all other ETs.\nThe Reptoids have no reported home planet. They also come over as entities\nwith little brain who control their bodies directly by spirit. This is a\ndescription of a ghost or disincarnate entity regardless of how people see\nthem. Thus it could be that the Reptoids, Erideans, Nordics, Anunnaki, but\nnot the Greys, all have origins on Earth and have a strong link to Earth\neven if they choose to live elsewhere. The Greys do not appear to have a\nrenal or urinary system and this points to them not originating on Earth.\nThe definitive work on dragons is \"The Flight of Dragons\" by Peter\nDickinson. If dragons did exist in the flesh, they did not survive the long\nbow. Targets do not come much bigger.\n\nTruth is stranger than fiction. Thus the writer\u0027s current scenario is that\nthere were a race of dinosaurs which developed psychic intelligence to guard\ntheir eggs and young, and who probably preferred to live underground. They\nsurvived the wipe out of the dinosaurs 50 million years ago with difficulty.\nThey evolved into the Erideans and transferred to a more hospitable planet\n(for them) possibly with the help of another race of ETs who wanted slaves\nbut otherwise had no interest in Earth or mind control.\n\nThus it appears that the current Reptoids are the Spirits or ghosts of the\ndinosaurs. They must have been powerful to survive 50 million years and also\nto appear to some people. They have appeared to the writer in remote\nviewing. They are living on as vampire entities. Such immortal minds are\ncontagious and can easily jump race and species barriers. If they can be\nencouraged to reincarnate, then the power sources of the black magicians and\nmind controllers will disappear. Encouraging them to reincarnate will help\nso called immortal minds to disappear as immortal minds have great\ndifficulty surviving reincarnation. Purging people\u0027s dinosaurs should remove\nall perverse psychic abilities not under their control. They are a source of\nSatanic Guardian Angels and demons. They control us by owning our psi. Thus\nif we regain ownership of psi, we must relinquish their control and that of\nall other mind controllers. Encourage people to regain ownership of their\npsi.\n\nTHE ORIGINS OF LOVE, HATE AND PURE MALICE. The following scenario appears to\nhold water and can account for the origins of our Universal Subconscious.\n\nDinosaurs laid their eggs and buried them either underground or in piles of\nrotting vegetation (a good source of beetles and grubs for young\nhatchelings). They did not sit on their eggs to keep them warm, which made\nthem very vulnerable to drastic climate and temperature change. In order to\nkeep away predators some at least developed psychic mind control. To do this\nthey had to capture ownership of the psi of potential predators. This is an\nact of hatred and outward looking. While a few dinosaurs did develop the\nability to bear living young, most did not. The dinosaurs got in first and\nso their mind control tends to override all other latter minds. They have\nbecome the source of all Satans, devils and demons.\n\nBirds on the other hand developed the ability to sit on their eggs and keep\nthem warm. A hen bird normally lays a series of eggs (say one per day) and\nonly starts sitting when the clutch is completely laid. Thus all eggs tend\nto hatch together as they all have an equal period of warmth. This is\nprimarily an act of love but inward looking. Bearing live young is not\nsuitable to a bird of the air. A pregnant pigeon would not fly very far.\nAntarctic penguins tuck a single egg between their legs to keep it warm,\neven if they are standing on ice.\n\nMammals developed live bearing of their young which is also primarily an act\nof love and inward looking. This is especially true as a mammalian female\ncan not desert her young in the womb in case of emergency as can a bird\nsitting on a nest.\n\nDinosaurs developed hate and mind control of others to protect their young,\nwhile birds and mammals developed love. Birds and mammals certainly do hate\nall enemies of their young, but this is secondary.\n\nIf one wants to purge the sources of malice of say a black magician, then\npurge his dinosaurs and his dinosaur eggs. Unfortunately most of our\nreligions are based on dinosaur protection of eggs and thus mind control,\nregardless of the front they put out to the public. Religion tends to\nconcentrate on \"How to Brainwash your Neighbour\". Conscious thought has\nbuilt many mighty empires, theologies and slave control systems out of using\n\"How to care for and protect one\u0027s young\" as a foundation.\n\nThus the foulest form of abuse possible is to call something \"A load of\ndinosaur\u0027s eggs\". Purging the dinosaurs and dinosaur\u0027s eggs of any entity\ntends to purge all malice back to its roots.\n\nIt looks as if mighty immortal minds have built up from small beginnings,\naided and abetted by various occultists and other. As they will insist on\nvampiring the living for energy to avoid reincarnation and disturbing the\nserenity of the writer, he encourages them to reincarnate.\n\nITEMS FOR INSPECTION. For mind control to take place, then someone must take\ncontrol or ownership of the target\u0027s psi and pleasure centres. Check for the\nfollowing.\n\nNest of dinosaur\u0027s eggs, holy dinosaurs, etc.\nEggs, controllers or owners in peoples psi, pleasure centres, pain killing\nhormones, abilities, etc.\nMind machines.\nThe original engraving or engram.\nGOD and SATAN appear to be job titles and not entities in their own right. T\nhey appear to be dinosaur engravings or engrams. No doubt dinosaurs were the\nfirst job holders.\nTIMETRACKS are worth investigating as our complete history from the start of\ntime.\n\nMy, our, Man\u0027s timetracks, etc.\nThe time tracks of the Universe, Universal Subconscious, Galactic\nSubconscious, etc.\nEXTINCT RACES of ETs can cause problems when they live on in vampire mode.\nTheir virtues may known to channelers but they can also have vices. Whenever\none hears of races which have evolved on to higher planes, suspect that the\nhigher plane is a vampire one. One may never know what they looked like or\nother basic characteristics, which makes linking back a trifle difficult.\nEvery extinct race, etc.\nBLOOD ANCESTORS are also worth investigating as minds can be passed down via\ngenetic linkages. Some of these can be over 2,000 years old.\nEvery blood ancestor, ancestral mind, genetic mind, etc.\n\n",

Dinosaurs Eggs and the Origins of Good and Evil.\n\u003e DINOSAURS. Reptoid ETs are reported to be 12 foot high crocodiles walking on\n\u003e their hind legs. This is a description of a dinosaur. It now appears in\n\u003e Remote Viewing that the Reptoid ETs, dinosaurs and dragons are all linked\n\u003e together and that they all originated on Earth. The Erideans who are Reptoid\n\u003e derivatives have a home planet (in the Eridanus system) like all other ETs.\n\u003e The Reptoids have no reported home planet. They also come over as entities\n\u003e with little brain who control their bodies directly by spirit. This is a\n\u003e description of a ghost or disincarnate entity regardless of how people see\n\u003e them. Thus it could be that the Reptoids, Erideans, Nordics, Anunnaki, but\n\u003e not the Greys, all have origins on Earth and have a strong link to Earth\n\u003e even if they choose to live elsewhere. The Greys do not appear to have a\n\u003e renal or urinary system and this points to them not originating on Earth.\n\u003e The definitive work on dragons is \"The Flight of Dragons\" by Peter\n\u003e Dickinson. If dragons did exist in the flesh, they did not survive the long\n\u003e bow. Targets do not come much bigger.\n\u003e \n\u003e Truth is stranger than fiction. Thus the writer\u0027s current scenario is that\n\u003e there were a race of dinosaurs which developed psychic intelligence to guard\n\u003e their eggs and young, and who probably preferred to live underground. They\n\u003e survived the wipe out of the dinosaurs 50 million years ago with difficulty.\n\u003e They evolved into the Erideans and transferred to a more hospitable planet\n\u003e (for them) possibly with the help of another race of ETs who wanted slaves\n\u003e but otherwise had no interest in Earth or mind control.\n\u003e \n\u003e Thus it appears that the current Reptoids are the Spirits or ghosts of the\n\u003e dinosaurs. They must have been powerful to survive 50 million years and also\n\u003e to appear to some people. They have appeared to the writer in remote\n\u003e viewing. They are living on as vampire entities. Such immortal minds are\n\u003e contagious and can easily jump race and species barriers. If they can be\n\u003e encouraged to reincarnate, then the power sources of the black magicians and\n\u003e mind controllers will disappear. Encouraging them to reincarnate will help\n\u003e so called immortal minds to disappear as immortal minds have great\n\u003e difficulty surviving reincarnation. Purging people\u0027s dinosaurs should remove\n\u003e all perverse psychic abilities not under their control. They are a source of\n\u003e Satanic Guardian Angels and demons. They control us by owning our psi. Thus\n\u003e if we regain ownership of psi, we must relinquish their control and that of\n\u003e all other mind controllers. Encourage people to regain ownership of their\n\u003e psi.\n\u003e \n\u003e THE ORIGINS OF LOVE, HATE AND PURE MALICE. The following scenario appears to\n\u003e hold water and can account for the origins of our Universal Subconscious.\n\u003e \n\u003e Dinosaurs laid their eggs and buried them either underground or in piles of\n\u003e rotting vegetation (a good source of beetles and grubs for young\n\u003e hatchelings). They did not sit on their eggs to keep them warm, which made\n\u003e them very vulnerable to drastic climate and temperature change. In order to\n\u003e keep away predators some at least developed psychic mind control. To do this\n\u003e they had to capture ownership of the psi of potential predators. This is an\n\u003e act of hatred and outward looking. While a few dinosaurs did develop the\n\u003e ability to bear living young, most did not. The dinosaurs got in first and\n\u003e so their mind control tends to override all other latter minds. They have\n\u003e become the source of all Satans, devils and demons.\n\u003e \n\u003e Birds on the other hand developed the ability to sit on their eggs and keep\n\u003e them warm. A hen bird normally lays a series of eggs (say one per day) and\n\u003e only starts sitting when the clutch is completely laid. Thus all eggs tend\n\u003e to hatch together as they all have an equal period of warmth. This is\n\u003e primarily an act of love but inward looking. Bearing live young is not\n\u003e suitable to a bird of the air. A pregnant pigeon would not fly very far.\n\u003e Antarctic penguins tuck a single egg between their legs to keep it warm,\n\u003e even if they are standing on ice.\n\u003e \n\u003e Mammals developed live bearing of their young which is also primarily an act\n\u003e of love and inward looking. This is especially true as a mammalian female\n\u003e can not desert her young in the womb in case of emergency as can a bird\n\u003e sitting on a nest.\n\u003e \n\u003e Dinosaurs developed hate and mind control of others to protect their young,\n\u003e while birds and mammals developed love. Birds and mammals certainly do hate\n\u003e all enemies of their young, but this is secondary.\n\u003e \n\u003e If one wants to purge the sources of malice of say a black magician, then\n\u003e purge his dinosaurs and his dinosaur eggs. Unfortunately most of our\n\u003e religions are based on dinosaur protection of eggs and thus mind control,\n\u003e regardless of the front they put out to the public. Religion tends to\n\u003e concentrate on \"How to Brainwash your Neighbour\". Conscious thought has\n\u003e built many mighty empires, theologies and slave control systems out of using\n\u003e \"How to care for and protect one\u0027s young\" as a foundation.\n\u003e \n\u003e Thus the foulest form of abuse possible is to call something \"A load of\n\u003e dinosaur\u0027s eggs\". Purging the dinosaurs and dinosaur\u0027s eggs of any entity\n\u003e tends to purge all malice back to its roots.\n\u003e \n\u003e It looks as if mighty immortal minds have built up from small beginnings,\n\u003e aided and abetted by various occultists and other. As they will insist on\n\u003e vampiring the living for energy to avoid reincarnation and disturbing the\n\u003e serenity of the writer, he encourages them to reincarnate.\n\u003e \n\u003e ITEMS FOR INSPECTION. For mind control to take place, then someone must take\n\u003e control or ownership of the target\u0027s psi and pleasure centres. Check for the\n\u003e following.\n\u003e \n\u003e Nest of dinosaur\u0027s eggs, holy dinosaurs, etc.\n\u003e Eggs, controllers or owners in peoples psi, pleasure centres, pain killing\n\u003e hormones, abilities, etc.\n\u003e Mind machines.\n\u003e The original engraving or engram.\n\u003e GOD and SATAN appear to be job titles and not entities in their own right. T\n\u003e hey appear to be dinosaur engravings or engrams. No doubt dinosaurs were the\n\u003e first job holders.\n\u003e TIMETRACKS are worth investigating as our complete history from the start of\n\u003e time.\n\u003e \n\u003e My, our, Man\u0027s timetracks, etc.\n\u003e The time tracks of the Universe, Universal Subconscious, Galactic\n\u003e Subconscious, etc.\n\u003e EXTINCT RACES of ETs can cause problems when they live on in vampire mode.\n\u003e Their virtues may known to channelers but they can also have vices. Whenever\n\u003e one hears of races which have evolved on to higher planes, suspect that the\n\u003e higher plane is a vampire one. One may never know what they looked like or\n\u003e other basic characteristics, which makes linking back a trifle difficult.\n\u003e Every extinct race, etc.\n\u003e BLOOD ANCESTORS are also worth investigating as minds can be passed down via\n\u003e genetic linkages. Some of these can be over 2,000 years old.\n\u003e Every blood ancestor, ancestral mind, genetic mind, etc.\n\u003e \n\n",

The\nPoles noticed that there were some\npatterns in the messages which were\nonly possible via certain plugboard\nsettings, and so:\n\n\u003e When we have collected several such cards corresponding to different\n\u003e initial signals ..., we place them in a pile so that the squares\n\u003e corresponding to the same daily settings are aligned and shine a\n\u003e light beneath the pile.  Only those squares which let the light\n\u003e through will correspond to possible daily settings.\n\nSo the brute force hardware allowed\nprecalculation of \"optical\" computing\ndevices which then narrowed down the\npossibilities enough for brute force\nto again be used for daily decodes,\nuntil:\n\n\u003e On 10 May, the Germans invaded France and, on the same day, in\n\u003e accordance with the best cryptographic principles, they changed their\n\u003e Enigma procedures in such a way that the 1560 Zygalski sheets, each\n\u003e with their carefully drilled 1000 or so holes, became just so much\n\u003e waste cardboard.\n\n-Dave\n\n::::::\n\n\u003e \u003e \"the first synthetic-aperture-radar processor was optical\"\n\nThis is also easy to believe, given Dr.\nElachi\u0027s description of the 1981 Shuttle\nImaging Radar:\n\n\u003e The received signal is recorded on an optical film which is retrieved\n\u003e after landing.  The film ... is then processed in an optical correlator\n\u003e to generate the final image.\n\nwhich makes sense, as one wishes to shift\neach component of the return in proportion\nto its frequency, for which one presumably\nneeds a glorified prism.\n\n\u003e Alternatively, the ... signal can be digitized and then recorded on\n\u003e board or transmitted to the ground via a digital data link.  This was\n\u003e the case with the ... sensor flown in 1984.\n\n::::::\n\n* Koerner, _The Pleasures of Counting_,\nin which various aspects of the Enigma\ndecoding cover four chapters, of which\nI quote from two sections of one:\n14.2: Beautiful Polish females, and\n14.3: Passing the torch\n\u003e Churchill\u0027s romantic soul loved the excitement and secrecy surrounding\n\u003e Bletchley.

Apple\u0027s private menu extras APIs were reverse\nengineered and leveraged to great effect. The architecture was so popular\nthat an application for managing predefined sets of menu extras (third\nparty or otherwise) was in development.\n\nAll of that changed with the release of Jaguar--but not because the\nprivate APIs had changed. If they had, third party developers would have\nupdated their applications to work with the new APIs, as they have\nresigned themselves to doing by choosing to use private APIs in the first\nplace.\n\nBut what actually happened in Jaguar was that Apple added code to forcibly\nexclude all non-Apple menu extras. Other parts of the API did not change.\nBut when a menu extra is loaded, it is compared to a hard-coded list of\n\"known\" menu extras from Apple. If the menu extra is not on that list, it\nis not allowed to load.\n\nIt\u0027s easy to laugh at Steve Ballmer\u0027s sweat-soaked gyrations as he chants\n\"developers, developers, developers!\", but Microsoft clearly understands\nsomething that Apple is still struggling with. It is in a platform\nvendor\u0027s best interest to encourage development for its platform. In\nApple\u0027s case, this doesn\u0027t mean that they have to bend over backwards to\nmake every single system service and UI element \"pluggable\" via public\nAPIs. That\u0027s clearly a lot of work, and not something that needs to be the\nnumber one priority for an OS in its infancy. And in the meantime, if\nthird party developers want to sell into a market that requires the\ndesired functionality to be added in \"unsupported\" ways, then they must be\nprepared for the maintenance consequences of their decisions.\n\nBut for Apple to go out of its way--to actually expend developer\neffort--to stop these third party developers, while still failing to\nprovide a supported alternative, is incredibly foolish. \"\n\n\n",

Blonds, It Seems, Will Survive After All\n\nOctober 2, 2002\nBy LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN \n\n\n\n\n \n\nApparently it fell into the category \"too good to check.\"\n\n\nLast Friday, several British newspapers reported that the\nWorld Health Organization had found in a study that blonds\nwould become extinct within 200 years, because blondness\nwas caused by a recessive gene that was dying out. The\nreports were repeated on Friday by anchors for the ABC News\nprogram \"Good Morning America,\" and on Saturday by CNN. \n\nThere was only one problem, the health organization said in\na statement yesterday that it never reported that blonds\nwould become extinct, and it had never done a study on the\nsubject. \n\n\"W.H.O. has no knowledge of how these news reports\noriginated,\" said the organization, an agency of the United\nNations based in Geneva, \"but would like to stress that we\nhave no opinion of the future existence of blonds.\" \n\nAll the news reports, in Britain and the United States,\ncited a study from the World Health Organization - \"a\nblonde-shell study,\" as The Daily Star of London put it.\nBut none reported any scientific details from the study or\nthe names of the scientists who conducted it. \n\nOn \"Good Morning America,\" Charles Gibson began a\nconversation with his co-anchor, Diane Sawyer, by saying:\n\"There\u0027s a study from the World Health Organization, this\nis for real, that blonds are an endangered species. Women\nand men with blond hair, eyebrows and blue eyes, natural\nblonds, they say will vanish from the face of the earth\nwithin 200 years, because it is not as strong a gene as\nbrunets.\" \n\nMs. Sawyer said she was \"somewhat of a natural blonde.\"\n\n\nJeffrey Schneider, a spokesman for ABC News, said the\nanchors got the information from an ABC producer in London\nwho said he had read it in a British newspaper. \n\nIn London, The Sun and The Express both reported that\nunnamed scientists said blonds would survive longest in\nScandinavia, where they are most concentrated, and expected\nthe last true blond to hail from Finland. \n\nThe British accounts were replete with the views of\nbleached blonds who said hairdressers would never allow\nblondness to become extinct, and doctors who said that rare\ngenes would pop up to keep natural blonds from becoming an\nendangered species. \n\nJournalists in London said last night that the source of\nthe reports was probably one of several European news\nagencies that are used by the British press, but it\nremained unclear which one. \n\nTim Hall, a night news editor at The Daily Mail, said the\nreport was probably distributed by The Press Association,\nBritain\u0027s domestic news agency. \"Several papers picked it\nup,\" he said. \n\nBut Charlotte Gapper, night editor at The Press\nAssociation, said that although it had considered running\nthe report on Sept. 27, it had decided not to after talking\nto the World Health Organization. \n\n\"We didn\u0027t do that story because we made an inquiry to the\nWorld Health Organization first,\" she said. \"They told us\nthat report was two years old, and had been covered at the\ntime. They said it had been picked up again that day by a\nGerman news agency.\" \n\nShe added that she did not know which agency the\norganization was referring to. \n\nDr. Ray White, a geneticist at the University of California\nat San Francisco, said that the disappearance of a gene for\nblond hair \"sounds patently incorrect.\"\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/02/health/02BLON.html?ex\u003d1034599071\u0026ei\u003d1\u0026en\u003d3a0e4f0b2b251593\n\n\n\nHOW TO ADVERTISE\n---------------------------------\nFor information on advertising in e-mail newsletters \nor other creative advertising opportunities with The \nNew York Times on the Web, please contact\nonlinesales@nytimes.com or visit our online media \nkit at http://www.nytimes.com/adinfo\n\nFor general information about NYTimes.com, write to \nhelp@nytimes.com.  \n\nCopyright 2002 The New York Times Company\n\n",

Thus, my book\nPrinciples of Programming Languages: Design, Evaluation, and Implementation, grew out of a study of teaching\nmethods in architecture, primarily, but also of pedagogy in other disciplines, such as aircraft design.\nPerhaps you\nhave also seen analogies drawn between programming languages and cars (FORTRAN \u003d Model T, C \u003d dune\nbuggy, etc.). \n\nThese analogies can be very informative, and can serve as ``intuition pumps\u0027\u0027 to enhance our creativity, but\nthey\ncannot be used uncritically because they are, in the end, just analogies. Ultimately our design decisions must\nbe\nbased on more than analogies, since analogies can be misleading as well as informative. \n\nIn this essay I\u0027ll address the role of aesthetics in programming language design, but I will base my remarks\non a\nbook about structural engineering, The Tower and the Bridge, by David P. Billington. Although there are many\ndifferences between bridges and programming languages, we will find that many ideas and insights transfer\nrather\ndirectly. \n\nAccording to Billington, there are three values common to many technological activities, which we can call\n``the\nthree E\u0027s\u0027\u0027: Efficiency, Economy and Elegance. These values correspond to three dimensions of technology,\nwhich\nBillington calls the scientific, social and symbolic dimensions (the three S\u0027s). We will consider each in\nturn. \n\n\nEfficiency Seeks to Minimize Resources Used\n\nIn structural engineering, efficiency deals with the amount of material used; the basic criterion is safety\nand the\nissues are scientific (strength of materials, disposition of forces, etc.). Similarly, in programming language\ndesign,\nefficiency is a scientific question dealing with the use of resources. There are many examples where\nefficiency\nconsiderations influenced programming language design (some are reviewed in my Principles of Programming\nLanguages). In the early days, the resources to be minimized were often runtime memory usage and processing\ntime, although compile-time resource utilization was also relevant. In other cases the resource economized was\nprogrammer typing time, and there are well-known cases in which this compromised safety (e.g. FORTRAN\u0027s\nimplicit declarations). There are also many well-known cases in which security (i.e. safety) was sacrificed\nfor the\nsake of efficiency by neglecting runtime error checking (e.g. array bounds checking). \n\nEfficiency issues often can be quantified in terms of computer memory or time, but we must be careful that we\nare\nnot comparing apples and oranges. Compile time is not interchangeable run time, and neither one is the same as\nprogrammer time. Similarly, computer memory cannot be traded off against computer time unless both are\nreduced to a common denominator, such as money, but this brings in economic considerations, to which we now\nturn. \n\n\nEconomy Seeks to Maximize Benefit versus Cost\n\nWhereas efficiency is a scientific issue, economy is a social issue. In structural engineering, economy seeks\nto\nmaximize social benefit compared to its cost. (This is especially appropriate since structures like bridges\nare\nusually built at public expense for the benefit of the public.) In programming language design, the ``public\u0027\u0027\nthat\nmust be satisfied is the programming community that will use the language and the institutions for which these\nprogrammers work. \n\nEconomic tradeoffs are hard to make because economic values change and are difficult to predict. For example,\nthe shift from first to second generation programming languages was largely a result of a decrease in the cost\nof\ncomputer time compared to programmer time, the shift from the second to the third generation involved the\nincreasing cost of residual bugs in programs, and the fourth generation reflected the increasing cost of\nprogram\nmaintenance compared to program development. \n\nOther social factors involved in the success or failure of a programming language include: whether major\nmanufacturers support the language, whether prestigious universities teach it, whether it is approved in some\nway\nby influential organizations (such as the US Department of Defense), whether it has been standardized, whether\nit\ncomes to be perceived as a ``real\u0027\u0027 language (used by ``real programmers\u0027\u0027) or as a ``toy\u0027\u0027 language (used by\nnovices\nor dilettantes), and so forth. As can be seen from the historical remarks in my Principles, social factors are\nfrequently more important than scientific factors in determining the success or failure of a programming\nlanguage. \n\nOften economic issues can be quantified in terms of money, but the monetary values of costs and benefits are\noften\nunstable and unpredictable because they depend on changing market forces. Also, many social issues, from\ndissatisfaction with poorly designed software to human misery resulting from system failures, are inaccurately\nrepresented by the single dimension of monetary cost. All kinds of ``cost\u0027\u0027 and ``benefit\u0027\u0027 must be considered\nin\nseeking an economical design. \n\n\nElegance Symbolizes Good Design\n\n``Elegance? Who cares about elegance?\u0027\u0027 snorts the hard-nosed engineer, but Billington shows clearly the\ncritical\nrole of elegance in ``hard-nosed\u0027\u0027 engineering. \n\nFor the Designer\n\nIt is well-known that feature interaction poses a serious problem for language designers because of the\ndifficulty\nof analyzing all the possible interactions of features in a language (see my Principles for examples).\nStructural\nengineers face similar problems of analytic complexity, but Billington observes that the best designers don\u0027t\nmake\nextensive use of computer models and calculation. \n\nOne reason is that mathematical analysis is always incomplete. The engineer must make a decision about which\nvariables are significant and which are not, and an analysis may lead to incorrect conclusions if this\ndecision is not\nmade well. Also, equations are often simplified (e.g., made linear) to make their analysis feasible, and this\nis\nanother potential source of error. Because of these limitations, engineers that depend on mathematical\nanalysis\nmay overdesign a structure to compensate for unforeseen effects left out of the analysis. Thus the price of\nsafety is\nadditional material and increased cost (i.e. decreased efficiency and economy). \n\nSimilarly in programming language design, the limitations of the analytic approach often force us to make a\nchoice between an under-engineered design, in which we run the risk of unanticipated interactions, and an\nover-engineered design, in which we have confidence, but which is inefficient or uneconomical. \n\nMany people have seen the famous film of the collapse in 1940 of the four-month-old Tacoma Narrows bridge; it\nvibrated itself to pieces in a storm because aerodynamical stability had not been considered in its design.\nBillington explains that this accident, along with a number of less dramatic bridge failures, was a\nconsequence of\nan increasing use of theoretical analyses that began in the 1920s. However, the very problem that destroyed\nthe\nTacoma Narrows bridge had been anticipated and avoided a century before by bridge designers who were guided\nby aesthetic principles. \n\nAccording to Billington, the best structural engineers do not rely on mathematical analysis (although they do\nnot\nabandon it altogether). Rather, their design activity is guided by a sense of elegance. This is because\nsolutions to\nstructural engineering problems are usually greatly underdetermined, that is, there are many possible\nsolutions to a\nparticular problem, such as bridging a particular river. Therefore, expert designers restrict their attention\nto\ndesigns in which the interaction of the forces is easy to see. The design looks unbalanced if the forces are\nunbalanced, and the design looks stable if it is stable. \n\nThe general principle is that designs that look good will also be good, and therefore the design process can\nbe\nguided by aesthetics without extensive (but incomplete) mathematical analysis. Billington expresses this idea\nby\ninverting the old architectural maxim and asserting that, in structural design, function follows form. He adds\n(p.\n21), ``When the form is well chosen, its analysis becomes astoundingly simple.\u0027\u0027 In other words, the choice of\nform is open and free, so we should pick forms where elegant design expresses good design (i.e. efficient and\neconomical design). If we do so, then we can let aesthetics guide design. \n\nThe same applies to programming language design. By restricting our attention to designs in which the\ninteraction\nof features is manifest - in which good interactions look good, and bad interactions look bad - we can let our\naesthetic sense guide our design and we can be much more confident that we have a good design, without having\nto\ncheck all the possible interactions. \n\nFor the User\n\nIn this case, what\u0027s good for the designer also is good for the user. Nobody is comfortable crossing a bridge\nthat\nlooks like it will collapse at any moment, and nobody is comfortable using a programming language in which\nfeatures may ``explode\u0027\u0027 if combined in the wrong way. The manifest balance of forces in a well-designed\nbridge\ngives us confidence when we cross it. So also, the manifestly good design of our programming language should\nreinforce our confidence when we program in it, because we have (well-justified) confidence in the\nconsequences\nof our actions. \n\nWe accomplish little by covering an unbalanced structure in a beautiful facade. When the bridge is unable to\nsustain the load for which it was designed, and collapses, it won\u0027t much matter that it was beautiful on the\noutside.\nSo also in programming languages. If the elegance is only superficial, that is, if it is not the manifestation\nof a\ndeep coherence in the design, then programmers will quickly see through the illusion and loose their\n(unwarranted)\nconfidence. \n\nIn summary, good designers choose to work in a region of the design space where good designs look good. As a\nconsequence, these designers can rely on their aesthetic sense, as can the users of the structures (bridges or\nprogramming languages) they design. We may miss out on some good designs this way, but they are of limited\nvalue unless both the designer and the user can be confident that they are good designs. We may summarize the\npreceding discussion in a maxim analogous to those in my Principles of Programming Languages: \n                                The Elegance Principle\n\n              Confine your attention to designs that look good because they are good. \n\n\n\nThe Programming Language as Work Environment\n\nThere are other reasons that elegance is relevant to a well-engineered programming language. The programming\nlanguage is something the professional programmer will live with - even live in. It should feel comfortable\nand\nsafe, like a well-designed home or office; in this way it can contribute to the quality of the activities that\ntake\nplace within it. Would you work better in an oriental garden or a sweatshop? \n\nA programming language should be a joy to use. This will encourage its use and decrease the programmer\u0027s\nfatigue\nand frustration. The programming language should not be a hindrance, but should serve more as a collaborator,\nencouraging programmers to do their jobs better. As some automobiles are ``driving machines\u0027\u0027 and work as a\nnatural extension of the driver, so a programming language should be a ``programming machine\u0027\u0027 by encouraging\nthe programmer to acquire the smooth competence and seemingly effortless skill of a virtuoso. The programming\nlanguage should invite the programmer to design elegant, efficient and economical programs. \n\nThrough its aesthetic dimension a programming language symbolizes many values. For example, in the variety of\nits features it may symbolize profligate excess, sparing economy or asceticism; the kind of its features may\nrepresent intellectual sophistication, down-to-earth practicality or ignorant crudeness. Thus a programming\nlanguage can promote a set of values. By embodying certain values, it encourages us to think about them; by\nneglecting or negating other values, it allows them to recede into the background and out of our attention.\nOut of\nsight, out of mind. \n\n\nAcquiring a Sense of Elegance\n\nAesthetics is notoriously difficult to teach, so you may wonder how you are supposed to acquire that refined\nsense\nof elegance necessary to good design. Billington observes that this sense is acquired through extensive\nexperience\nin design, which, especially in Europe, is encouraged by a competitive process for choosing bridge designers.\nBecause of it, structural engineers design many more bridges than they build, and they learn from each\ncompetition they loose by comparing their own designs with those of the winner and other losers. The public\nalso\ncritiques the competing designs, and in this way becomes more educated; their sense of elegance develops along\nwith that of the designers. \n\nSo also, to improve as a programming language designer you should design many languages - design obsessively -\nand criticize, revise and discard your designs. You should also evaluate and criticize other people\u0027s designs\nand try\nto improve them. In this way you will acquire the body of experience you will need when the ``real thing\u0027\u0027\ncomes\nalong. \n\n\nReferences\n\n   1.Billington, David P., The Tower and the Bridge: The New Art of Structural Engineering, Princeton:\n     Princeton University Press, 1983.

    "message": "\nSpamAssassin is hurting democracy!\nOwen\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nhttp://www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/news/opinion/3900215.htm\n\nInternet can level the political playing field\nBy Mike McCurry and Larry Purpuro\n\nNOT many months from now, people across the country will experience one \nof the great recurring features of American democracy. At shopping \nmalls, on factory floors, at church socials and even on our front \nstoops, we will be approached by individuals who want to represent us in \npublic office. While chances are high that we won\u0027t know them \npersonally, they will walk up to us, offer a handshake and a flier and \nask for our votes.\n\nJust as technology is affecting every other area of communication, it \nhas begun to affect the way political candidates communicate with voters.\n\nIn this year\u0027s GOP gubernatorial primary, California Secretary of State \nBill Jones, who faced better-funded candidates, acquired the e-mail \naddresses of more than a million potential California voters and sent \neach an unsolicited e-mail asking for support.\n\nThat day, he might have chosen any of the more traditional -- and more \nexpensive -- methods of contacting voters, such as direct mail, radio \nspots or TV ads. But he spent only about 2 cents per message, instead of \n35 cents or more per message for direct mail or in another medium.\n\nHad Jones chosen direct mail, radio or TV, that communication would have \nbeen equally ``unsolicited,\u0027\u0027 as defined in the e-mail world. Few voters \nwould have ``opted in\u0027\u0027 to receive campaign information from Jones \nthrough any of those channels.\n\nThe response to Jones\u0027 e-mail effort, however, was swift and intense. He \nwas lambasted by anti-spam advocates, and media coverage was almost \nentirely negative. To be fair, some of Jones\u0027 tactics could have been \nrefined. He used a less-than-perfect list and no standard-practice \n``paid for\u0027\u0027 disclaimer in the message.\n\nHis detractors, however, attacked him not for his tactical miscues but \nbecause the e-mail was sent unsolicited. In fact, Jones\u0027 online campaign \nmay have been his most visible asset. In an era of cynicism toward money \nin politics -- money typically spent on other unsolicited communication \nmediums -- Jones tried to level the playing field.\n\nNo one likes commercial spam. It is irrelevant and untargeted and can be \nhighly intrusive and even offensive. But as a sophisticated society, \nit\u0027s time to differentiate commercial spam from very different \nunsolicited e-mail sent by political candidates to voters.\n\nThe debate is particularly relevant in light of legislation in Congress \nthat would constitute the first federal law to directly address spam. We \nbelieve e-mail is no more intrusive than direct mail, telemarketing or \nTV advertising when it comes to politicians seeking to reach voters. A \nsimple link in good e-mail campaigns allows recipients to opt out of \nfuture mailings. Direct mail takes at least a phone call or stamp to be \ntaken off a list, and viewers must repeatedly endure TV ads.\n\nWhen a candidate lacks a large campaign war chest, he or she can use the \nInternet to provide constituents with information to better prepare them \nto perform their civic duty of casting educated votes. With more than 60 \npercent of all potential voters in this country possessing e-mail \naccounts, it makes sense that political candidates use this medium.\n\nCandidates might avoid some of the tactical problems encountered by the \nJones campaign if they use the technologies available today that better \nensure quality of e-mail lists and target content to specific recipient \ngroups.\n\nBut the broader point remains. When a political candidate sends a voter \nan e-mail, that recipient can choose to delete the message without \nopening it, unsubscribe from the list, read it or even reply and engage \nthe sender. That choice should belong to the voter -- not to anti-spam \nadvocates whose efforts are better focused on commercial e-mail. \nPolitical candidates should be free to communicate with voters as best \nthey can, and let voters decide what to do with that information.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMike McCurry, former press secretary for President Clinton, is CEO of an \nadvocacy management and communications software company. Larry Purpuro, \nthe former Republican National Committee deputy chief of staff, is \nfounder and president of a political e-marketing firm.

Just transferring\ntitle to an existing lot, between parties\nwho have money, ought not to be a problem.\n\nThe obvious solution, at least to us\nbarking farting chihuahuas on FoRK, is\nto \"introduce market mechanisms\".  It is\nleft as an exercise to come up with one\nwhich works when many of the agents (are\nperceived to) have negligible NPV.\n\n-Dave\n\n\u003e              [land reform] meant that all the agricultural producers had\n\u003e to plant crops all the time (profitable or not) ...\n\nWhat happened to more highly-capitalized\nland?  Putting in trees instead of crops\nsounds like it might sidestep that.\n\n\u003e Mr. Long, I think you\u0027d particularly enjoy the De Soto work.\n\nOn the \"to find\" list.

[Why was it that] a significant rate\nof capital formation was possible only in certain sectors and not in the\nwhole market economy of the time? ... It would perhaps be teasingly\nparadoxial to say that whatever was in short supply, money certainly was\nnot ... so this was an age where poor land was bought up and magnificent\ncountry residents built ... [How do we] resolve the contradiction ...\nbetween the depressed economic climate and the splendors of Florence\nunder Lorenzo the Magnificent?\n \n\n--------------\n\nDe Soto\u0027s theory is that the Bell Jar is formed when you segregate those\nwho have *practical* access to legal property rights and those who do\nnot.  The poor[1] have property -- lots and lots of property.  What they\ndon\u0027t have is access to the systems where we turn property into capital\nand allow it to start growing.  Their property can only be exchanged\nwith a small section of people who know them personally.\n\n[1] Actual poor people, not \u0027poor\u0027 Americans with a living standard that\nis the envy of most of the world.\n\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n",

Bush proclaimed, \"The problem with\nthe French is that they don\u0027t have a word for entrepreneur.\"\n\nStatus:   False.\n\nOrigins:   Yet another French fried \"George W. Bush is dumb\"\nstory has been taken up by those who like their caricatures\ndrawn in stark, bold lines. According to scuttlebutt that\nemerged in the British press in July 2002, President Bush,\nBritain\u0027s Prime Minister Tony Blair, and France\u0027s President\nJacques Chirac were discussing economics and, in particular,\nthe decline of the French economy. \"The problem with the\nFrench,\" Bush afterwards confided in Blair, \"is that they don\u0027t\nhave a word for entrepreneur.\"\n\nThe source was Shirley Williams, also known as the Baroness\nWilliams of Crosby, who claimed \"my good friend Tony Blair\" had\nrecently regaled her with this anecdote in Brighton.\n\nLloyd Grove of The Washington Post was unable to reach Baroness\nWilliams to gain her confirmation of the tale, but he did\nreceive a call from Alastair Campbell, Blair\u0027s director of\ncommunications and strategy. \"I can tell you that the prime\nminister never heard George Bush say that, and he certainly\nnever told Shirley Williams that President Bush did say it,\"\nCampbell told The Post. \"If she put this in a speech, it must\nhave been a joke.\"\n\nThis is far from the first time Bush has been made the butt of\na jibe meant to showcase what some perceive as his less than\nstellar intellectual abilities. Without straining our memories\ntoo hard, we can come up with three other instances we\u0027ve\nchronicled on this site. In the summer of 2001, the joke of the\nmoment centered upon a supposed study that had resulted in the\nranking of Presidential IQs, with George W. Bush being pegged\nas the Chief Executive who scraped the bottom of the\nintelligence barrel. In December 2000 it was a fake Nostradamus\nquatrain which pontificated that the \"village idiot\" would win\nthe 2000 Presidential election. And in the spring of 2002, it\nwas the story of Bush\u0027s waving at Stevie Wonder that set folks\nto chortling up their sleeves.\n\nStories that illustrate this widely believed intellectual\nshortcoming will always waft after George W. Bush because they\nseemingly confirm what many already hold as true about this\npublic figure, that he\u0027s not the brightest fellow that\u0027s ever\nbeen. It is human nature to revel in yarns that the hearer at\nsome level agrees with, thus tales of this sort will always\nfall upon appreciative ears.\n\nBarbara \"ears of corn\" Mikkelson\n\nLast updated:   29 July 2002\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n",

A proposed law based on the discussion \ndraft is expected to be introduced in Parliament late this year or in \nearly 2003.\n\nArguing that more and more communications take place in electronic form, \nCanadian officials say such laws are necessary to fight terrorism and \ncombat even run-of-the-mill crimes. They also claim that by enacting \nthese proposals, Canada will be following its obligations under the \nCouncil of Europe\u0027s cybercrime treaty \n\u003chttp://news.com.com/2100-1001-268894.html\u003e, which the country is in the \nprocess of considering.\n\nIf the discussion draft were to become law, it would outlaw the \npossession of computer viruses, authorize police to order Internet \nproviders to retain logs of all Web browsing for up to six months, and \npermit police to obtain a search warrant allowing them to find \"hidden \nelectronic and digital devices\" that a suspect might be concealing. In \nmost circumstances, a court order would be required for government \nagents to conduct Internet monitoring.\n\nCanada and the United States are nonvoting members of the Council of \nEurope, and representatives from both countries\u0027 police agencies have \nendorsed the controversial cybercrime treaty \n\u003chttp://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/CadreListeTraites.htm\u003e, which has \ndrawn protests from human rights activists and civil liberties groups. \nOf nearly 50 participating nations, only Albania has formally adopted \n\u003chttp://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/searchsig.asp?NT\u003d185\u0026CM\u003d8\u0026DF\u003d27/08/02\u003e, \nor ratified, the treaty.\n\nMichael Geist \u003chttp://aix1.uottawa.ca/%7Egeist/\u003e, a professor at the \nUniversity of Ottawa who specializes in e-commerce law, says that the \njustification for adopting such sweeping changes to Canadian law seems \nweak.\n\n\"It seems to me that the main justification they\u0027ve given for all the \nchanges is that we want to ratify the cybercrime treaty and we need to \nmake changes,\" Geist said. \"To me that\u0027s not a particularly convincing \nargument. If there are new powers needed for law enforcement authority, \nmake that case.\"\n\nGeist added that \"there\u0027s nothing in the document that indicates (new \npowers) are needed. I don\u0027t know that there have been a significant \nnumber of cases where police have run into problems.\"\n\nProbably the most sweeping change the legal blueprint contemplates is \ncompelling Internet providers and telephone companies to reconfigure \ntheir networks to facilitate government eavesdropping and data-retention \norders. The United States has a similar requirement, called the \nCommunications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act \n\u003chttp://www.epic.org/privacy/wiretap/calea/calea_law.html\u003e, but it \napplies only to pre-Internet telecommunications companies.\n\n\"It is proposed that all service providers (wireless, wireline and \nInternet) be required to ensure that their systems have the technical \ncapability to provide lawful access to law enforcement and national \nsecurity agencies,\" according to the proposal. Companies would be \nresponsible for paying the costs of buying new equipment.\n\nSarah Andrews, an analyst at the Electronic Privacy Information Center \n\u003chttp://www.epic.org/\u003e (EPIC) who specializes in international law, says \nthe proposal goes beyond what the cybercrime treaty specifies. \"Their \nproposal for intercept capability talks about all service providers, not \njust Internet providers,\" Andrews said. \"The cybercrime treaty deals \nonly with computer data.\" EPIC opposes \n\u003chttp://www.privacyinternational.org/issues/cybercrime/coe/ngo_letter_601.htm\u003e \nthe cybercrime treaty, saying it grants too much power to police and \ndoes not adequately respect privacy rights.\n\nAnother section of the proposal says the Canadian Association of Chiefs \nof Police recommends \"the establishment of a national database\" with \npersonal information about all Canadian Internet users. \"The \nimplementation of such a database would presuppose that service \nproviders are compelled to provide accurate and current information,\" \nthe draft says.\n\nGus Hosein, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics and an \nactivist with Privacy International, calls the database \"a dumb idea.\"\n\n\"Immediately you have to wonder if you\u0027re allowed to use anonymous \nmobile phones or whether you\u0027re allowed to connect to the Internet \nanonymously,\" Hosein said.\n\nA representative for George Radwanski \n\u003chttp://www.privcom.gc.ca/au_e.asp\u003e, Canada\u0027s privacy commissioner, said \nthe office is reviewing the blueprint and does not \"have any comments on \nthe paper as it stands.\"\n\nComments on the proposal can be sent to la-al@justice.gc.ca \n\u003cmailto:la-al@justice.gc.ca\u003e no later than Nov. 15.\n\n\n\n",

Rohit\n\u003e \n\u003e\u003e A Trip to F.C.C. World\n\u003e\u003e\n\u003e\u003e Nicholas Lemann has a piece in the New Yorker this week about FCC \n\u003e\u003e Chairman Michael Powell.  It\u0027s one of the first articles I\u0027ve seen \n\u003e\u003e that captures some of Powell\u0027s real personality, and the way he\u0027s \n\u003e\u003e viewed in Washington.  Unfortunately, Lemann ends by endorsing \n\u003e\u003e conventional political wisdom.  After describing how Powell isn\u0027t \n\u003e\u003e really a fire-breathing ideological conservative, he concludes that, \n\u003e\u003e in essence, Powell favors the inumbent local Bell telephone companies, \n\u003e\u003e while a Democratic FCC would favor new entrants.  I know that\u0027s not \n\u003e\u003e how Powell sees the world, and though I disagree with him on many \n\u003e\u003e issues, I think he\u0027s right to resist the old dichotomy.\n\u003e\u003e\n\u003e\u003e The telecom collapse should be a humbling experience for anyone who \n\u003e\u003e went through it.  The disaster wasn\u0027t the regulators\u0027 fault, as some \n\u003e\u003e conservatives argue.  But something clearly went horribly wrong, and \n\u003e\u003e policy-makers should learn from that experience.  Contrary to Lemann\u0027s \n\u003e\u003e speculation, the upstart carriers won\u0027t be successful in a Gore \n\u003e\u003e administration, because it\u0027s too late.  Virtually all of them are \n\u003e\u003e dead, and Wall Street has turned off the capital tap for the \n\u003e\u003e foreseeable future.  Some may survive, but as small players rather \n\u003e\u003e than world-dominators. \n\u003e\u003e\n\u003e\u003e The battle between CLECs and RBOCs that Lemann so astutely parodies is \n\u003e\u003e old news.  The next important battle in telecom will be between those \n\u003e\u003e who want to stay within the traditional boxes, and those who use \n\u003e\u003e different models entirely.  That\u0027s why open broadband networks and \n\u003e\u003e open spectrum are so important.  Whatever the regulatory environment, \n\u003e\u003e there is going to be consolidation in telecom.  Those left out in that \n\u003e\u003e consolidation will face increasing pressure to create new pipes into \n\u003e\u003e the home, or slowly die. The victors in the consolidation game will \n\u003e\u003e cut back on innovation and raise prices, which will create further \n\u003e\u003e pressure for alternatives. \n\u003e\u003e\n\u003e\u003e Lemann is right that policy-making looks much drier and more ambiguous \n\u003e\u003e on the ground than through the lens of history.

I was shocked. What about Gettysburg \n\u003e and the Declaration of Independence and the Selma-to-Montgomery march? \n\u003e Just look at my textbook, he said, and when I did I saw his point. His \n\u003e class had got up to the eighteen-forties. What I expected was a big \n\u003e beefing up of the roles of Sacagawea and Crispus Attucks, and, in-deed, \n\u003e there was some of that. But the main difference between my son\u0027s text \n\u003e and that of my own childhood was that somebody had made the disastrous \n\u003e decision to devote most of it to what had actually happened in American \n\u003e history. There were pages and pages on tariffs and bank charters and \n\u003e reciprocal trade agreements. I skipped ahead, past the Civil War, hoping \n\u003e for easier going, only to encounter currency floats and the regulation \n\u003e of freight rates. Only a few decades into the twentieth century did it \n\u003e become possible to see the federal government\u0027s main function as \n\u003e responding to dramatic crises and launching crusades for social justice, \n\u003e instead of attempting to referee competing claims from economic interests.\n\u003e \n\u003e Even now, if one were to reveal what really goes on behind the pretty \n\u003e speeches and the sanctimonious hearings in Washington, what you\u0027d find \n\u003e is thousands of lawyers and lobbyists madly vying for advantage, not so \n\u003e much over the public as over each other: agribusiness versus real \n\u003e estate, banks versus insurance companies, and so on. The arena in which \n\u003e this competition mainly takes place is regulatory agencies and \n\u003e commissions and the congressional committees that supervise them. It\u0027s \n\u003e an insider\u0027s game, less because the players are secretive than because \n\u003e the public and the press�encouraged by the players, who speak in jargon�\n\u003e can\u0027t get themselves interested.\n\u003e \n\u003e One corner of Washington might be called F.C.C. World, for the Federal \n\u003e Communications Commission. F.C.C. World has perhaps five thousand \n\u003e denizens. They work at the commission itself, at the House and Senate \n\u003e commerce committees, and at the Washington offices of the companies that \n\u003e the commission regulates. They read Communications Daily (subscription \n\u003e price: $3,695 a year), and every year around Christmastime they \n\u003e grumblingly attend the Chairman\u0027s Dinner, at a Washington hotel, where \n\u003e the high point of the evening is a scripted, supposedly self-deprecating \n\u003e comedy routine by the commission\u0027s chairman.\n\u003e \n\u003e Of all the federal agencies and commissions, the F.C.C. is the one that \n\u003e Americans ought to be most interested in; after all, it is involved with \n\u003e a business sector that accounts for about fifteen per cent of the \n\u003e American economy, as well as important aspects of daily life�telephone \n\u003e and television and radio and newspapers and the Internet. And right now \n\u003e F.C.C. World is in, if not a crisis, at least a very soapy lather, \n\u003e because a good portion of what the angry public thinks of as the \n\u003e \"corporate scandals\" concerns the economic collapse of companies \n\u003e regulated by the F.C.C. Qwest, WorldCom, Adelphia, and Global Crossing, \n\u003e among others, are (or were) part of F.C.C. World. AOL Time Warner is \n\u003e part of F.C.C. World. Jack Grubman, the former Salomon Smith Barney \n\u003e analyst who seems to have succeeded Kenneth Lay, of Enron, as the \n\u003e embodiment of the corporate scandals, is part of F.C.C. World. In the \n\u003e past two years, companies belonging to F.C.C. World have lost trillions \n\u003e of dollars in stock-market valuation, and have collectively served as a \n\u003e dead weight pulling down the entire stock market.\n\u003e \n\u003e This year, an alarmed and acerbic anonymous memorandum about the state \n\u003e of the F.C.C. has been circulating widely within F.C.C. World. It evokes \n\u003e F.C.C. World\u0027s feverish mood (\"The F.C.C. is fiddling while Rome burns\") \n\u003e and suggests why nobody besides residents of F.C.C. World has thought of \n\u003e the commission in connection with the corporate scandals. The sentence I \n\u003e just quoted is followed by this explanation: \"The ILECs appear likely to \n\u003e enter all l.d. markets within twelve months, while losing virtually no \n\u003e residential customers to attackers since 1996, and suffering about 10% \n\u003e market share loss in business lines to CLECs.\" It\u0027s a lot easier to \n\u003e think about evil C.E.O.s than to decipher that.\n\u003e \n\u003e \n\u003e Even in good times, F.C.C. World pays obsessive attention to the \n\u003e commission\u0027s chairman. In bad times, the attention becomes especially \n\u003e intense; and when the chairman is a celebrity F.C.C. World devotes \n\u003e itself to full-time chairman-watching. The current chairman, Michael \n\u003e Powell, is a celebrity, at least by government-official standards, \n\u003e because he is the only son of Colin Powell, the Secretary of State. \n\u003e Unlike his father, he has a kind of mesmerizing ambiguity, which \n\u003e generates enormous, and at times apoplectically toned, speculation about \n\u003e who he really is and what he\u0027s really up to. Powell is young to be the \n\u003e head of a federal agency�he is thirty-nine�and genially charming. \n\u003e Everybody likes him. Before becoming chairman, he was for three years \n\u003e one of the F.C.C.\u0027s five commissioners; not only is he fluent in the \n\u003e F.C.C.\u0027s incomprehensible patois, he has a Clintonesque love of the \n\u003e arcane details of communications policy. He\u0027s always saying that he\u0027s an \n\u003e \"avid moderate.\" And yet he has a rage-inciting quality. One of his \n\u003e predecessors as chairman, Reed Hundt, quoted in Forbes, compared Powell \n\u003e to Herbert Hoover. Mark Cooper, of the Consumer Federation of America, \n\u003e calls him \"radical and extreme.\" Just as often as he\u0027s accused of being \n\u003e a right-wing ideologue, Powell gets accused of being paralytically \n\u003e cautious. \"It ain\u0027t about singing \u0027Kum-Ba-Yah\u0027 around the campfire,\" \n\u003e another former chairman, William Kennard, says. \"You have to have an \n\u003e answer.\" One day last spring, Powell, testifying before a Senate \n\u003e subcommittee, delivered an anodyne opening statement, and the \n\u003e subcommittee\u0027s chairman, Ernest Hollings, of South Carolina, berated \n\u003e him. \"You don\u0027t care about these regulations,\" Hollings said. \"You don\u0027t \n\u003e care about the law or what Congress sets down. . . . That\u0027s the \n\u003e fundamental. That\u0027s the misgiving I have of your administration over \n\u003e there. It just is amazing to me. You just pell-mell down the road and \n\u003e seem to not care at all. I think you\u0027d be a wonderful executive \n\u003e vice-president of a chamber of commerce, but not a chairman of a \n\u003e regulatory commission at the government level. Are you happy in your job?\"\n\u003e \n\u003e \"Extremely,\" Powell said, with an amiable smile.\n\u003e \n\u003e \n\u003e One cannot understand Powell\u0027s maddening effect, at least on Democrats \n\u003e and liberal activists, without understanding not just the stated purpose \n\u003e of the commission he chairs but also its real purpose. The F.C.C. was \n\u003e created by Congress in 1934, but it existed in prototype well before the \n\u003e New Deal, because it performs a function that is one of the classic easy \n\u003e cases for government intervention in the private economy: making sure \n\u003e that broadcasters stick to their assigned spots on the airwaves. Its \n\u003e other original function was preventing American Telephone \u0026 Telegraph, \n\u003e the national monopoly phone company, from treating its customers \n\u003e unfairly. Over the decades, as F.C.C. World grew up into a comfortable, \n\u003e well-established place, the F.C.C. segued into the role of industrial \n\u003e supervision�its real purpose. It was supposed to manage the competition \n\u003e among communications companies so that it didn\u0027t become too bloody, by \n\u003e artfully deciding who would be allowed to enter what line of business. \n\u003e In addition to looking out for the public\u0027s interest, the commission \n\u003e more specifically protected the interests of members of Congress, many \n\u003e of whom regard the media companies in their districts as the single most \n\u003e terrifying category of interest group�you can cross the local bank \n\u003e president and live to tell the tale, but not the local broadcaster. \n\u003e According to an oft-told F.C.C. World anecdote, President Clinton once \n\u003e blocked an attempt to allow television stations to buy daily newspapers \n\u003e in the same city because, he said, if the so-and-so who owned the \n\u003e anti-Clinton Little Rock Democrat-Gazette had owned the leading TV \n\u003e station in Little Rock, too, Clinton would never have become President.\n\u003e \n\u003e \n\u003e F.C.C. World may have been con tentious, but it was settled, too, \n\u003e because all the reasonably powerful players had created secure economic \n\u003e niches for themselves. Then, in the nineteen-eighties, the successful \n\u003e breakup of A.T. \u0026 T.�by far the biggest and most important company the \n\u003e commission regulated�deposited a thick additional sediment of \n\u003e self-confidence onto the consciousness of F.C.C. World. A generation \n\u003e ago, for most Americans, there was one local phone company, one \n\u003e long-distance company, and one company that manufactured telephones, \n\u003e which customers were not permitted to own�and they were all the same \n\u003e company. It was illegal to plug any device into a phone line. By the \n\u003e mid-nineteen-nineties, there were a dozen economically viable local \n\u003e phone companies, a handful of national long-distance companies competing \n\u003e to offer customers the lowest price and best service, and stores \n\u003e everywhere selling telephone equipment from many manufacturers�and \n\u003e millions of Americans had a fax machine and a modem operating over the \n\u003e telephone lines. A.T. \u0026 T. had argued for years that it was a \"natural \n\u003e monopoly,\" requiring protection from economic competition and total \n\u003e control over its lines. So much for that argument. Over the same period, \n\u003e the F.C.C. had assisted in the birth of cable television and cell phones \n\u003e and the Internet. It was the dream of federal-agency success come true: \n\u003e consumers vastly better served, and the industry much bigger and more \n\u003e prosperous, too.\n\u003e \n\u003e The next big step was supposed to be the Telecommunications Act of 1996, \n\u003e one of those massive, endlessly lobbied-over pieces of legislation which \n\u003e most people outside F.C.C. World probably felt it was safe to ignore. \n\u003e Although the Telecom Act sailed under the rhetorical banner of \n\u003e modernization and deregulation, its essence was a grand interest-group \n\u003e bargain, in which the local phone companies, known to headline writers \n\u003e as \"baby Bells\" and to F.C.C. World as \"arbocks\" (the pronounced version \n\u003e of RBOCs, or regional Bell operating companies), would be permitted to \n\u003e offer long-distance service in exchange for letting the long-distance \n\u003e companies and smaller new phone companies use their lines to compete for \n\u003e customers. Consumers would win, because for the first time they would \n\u003e get the benefits of competition in local service while getting even more \n\u003e competition than they already had in long distance. But the politics and \n\u003e economics of the Telecom Act (which was shepherded through Congress by \n\u003e Vice-President Gore) were just as important. Democrats saw the act as \n\u003e helping to reposition them as the technology party�the party that \n\u003e brought the Internet into every home, created hundreds of thousands of \n\u003e jobs in new companies, and, not least, set off an investment boom whose \n\u003e beneficiaries might become the party\u0027s new contributor base. Clinton\u0027s \n\u003e slogans about the \"information superhighway\" and \"building a bridge to \n\u003e the twenty-first century,\" which, like all Clinton slogans, artfully \n\u003e sent different messages to different constituencies, were the rhetorical \n\u003e correlates of the Telecom Act, and Gore\u0027s cruise to the Presidency was \n\u003e supposed to be powered substantially by the act\u0027s success.\n\u003e \n\u003e The F.C.C. had a crucial role in all this. The arbocks are rich, \n\u003e aggressive, politically powerful, and generally Republican (though like \n\u003e all important interest groups they work with both parties); they \n\u003e immediately filed lawsuits, which wound up tying the hands of their new \n\u003e competitors in the local phone market for more than three years. Through \n\u003e rule-making, enforcement, and litigation, the F.C.C., then headed by \n\u003e Reed Hundt, who was Gore\u0027s classmate at St. Albans, was supposed to keep \n\u003e the arbocks in their cages, so that not only long-distance companies \n\u003e like A.T. \u0026 T. and MCI WorldCom but also a whole category of new \n\u003e companies, \"see-lecks\" (the pronounced version of CLECs, or competitive \n\u003e local exchange carriers), could emerge. This entailed the regulatory \n\u003e equivalent of hand-to-hand combat: the see-leck is supposed to have \n\u003e access to the arbock\u0027s switching equipment, the arbock won\u0027t give the \n\u003e seeleck a key to the room where it\u0027s kept, so the see-leck asks the \n\u003e F.C.C. to rule that the arbock has to give it the key.\n\u003e \n\u003e Partly because Hundt assured the see-lecks and other new companies that \n\u003e he would protect them, and partly because of the generally booming \n\u003e condition of the economy then, investment capital flooded into the \n\u003e see-lecks�companies with names like Winstar, Covad, and Teligent�and \n\u003e into other telecommunications companies. Even not obviously related \n\u003e technology companies like Cisco Systems benefitted from the telecom \n\u003e boom: demand for their products was supposed to come from the see-lecks \n\u003e and other new players. There would be no conflict between the interests \n\u003e of the new telecom companies and those of consumers; as one of Hundt\u0027s \n\u003e former lieutenants told me, \"Reed used to joke that my job was to make \n\u003e sure that all prices went down and all stocks went up.\"\n\u003e \n\u003e \n\u003e The years following the passage of the Telecom Act were the peak of the \n\u003e boom. Wall Street had its blood up, and that meant not just more \n\u003e startups but also more mergers of existing communications companies: \n\u003e Time Warner and AOL decided to throw in together, and A.T. \u0026 T. and \n\u003e Comcast, and so on. (Surely, WorldCom and the other telecom bad guys \n\u003e believed that their self-dealing, stock-overselling, and creative \n\u003e accounting would go unnoticed because the market was so undiscriminating.)\n\u003e \n\u003e By the time the outcome of the 2000 Presidential election had been \n\u003e determined, the telecom crash was well under way. Nonetheless, the \n\u003e chairmanship of the F.C.C. remained one of the best jobs, in terms of \n\u003e influence and visibility, available to a career government regulator. \n\u003e Three Republicans emerged as candidates: Powell, who was a commissioner; \n\u003e Harold Furchtgott-Roth, the farthest-to-the-right commissioner; and \n\u003e Patrick Wood, the head of the Texas Public Utility Commission and, as \n\u003e such, a George W. Bush guy. In Texas, however, Wood had crossed the most \n\u003e powerful user in the arbock camp, Edward Whitacre, the C.E.O. of\n\u003e S.B.C. Communications, which is headquartered in San Antonio. This meant \n\u003e that the arbocks didn\u0027t want Wood as head of the F.C.C., because he \n\u003e might be too pro-see-leck. (Wood is now the head of the Federal Energy \n\u003e Regulatory Commission.) Michael Powell had to signal the arbocks that he \n\u003e wasn\u0027t as threatening as Wood, while also signalling the conservative \n\u003e movement that he was only negligibly farther to the left than \n\u003e Furchtgott-Roth.\n\u003e \n\u003e Powell did this deftly. For example, in December of 2000 he appeared \n\u003e before a conservative group called the Progress \u0026 Freedom Foundation and \n\u003e gave a very Michael Powell speech�whimsical, intellectual, and \n\u003e free-associative (Biblical history, Joseph Schumpeter, Moore\u0027s Law)�that \n\u003e began by making fun of the idea that the F.C.C. should try to keep new \n\u003e telecom companies alive. \"In the wake of the 1996 Act, the F.C.C. is \n\u003e often cast as the Grinch who stole Christmas,\" Powell said. \"Like the \n\u003e Whos, down in Who-ville, who feast on Who-pudding and rare Who-roast \n\u003e beast, the communications industry was preparing to feast on the \n\u003e deregulatory fruits it believed would inevitably sprout from the Act\u0027s \n\u003e fertile soil. But this feast the F.C.C. Grinch did not like in the \n\u003e least, so it is thought.\" Thus Powell was indicating that if he became \n\u003e chairman he didn\u0027t expect to administer first aid to the see-lecks as \n\u003e part of the job. He was appointed to the chairmanship on the first day \n\u003e of the Bush Administration.\n\u003e \n\u003e Twenty months into the Administration, nearly all the see-lecks are dead \n\u003e or dying; nearly all long-distance companies, not just WorldCom, are in \n\u003e serious trouble; cable companies have lost half their value; satellite \n\u003e companies are staggering. The crash has had an automatically \n\u003e concentrating effect, because as new companies die the existing \n\u003e companies\u0027 market share increases, and, if the existing companies are in \n\u003e good shape financially, they have the opportunity to pick up damaged \n\u003e companies at bargain prices. During the Bush Administration, as the \n\u003e financial carnage in communications has worsened, the communications \n\u003e industry has moved in the direction of more concentration. If the Bells \n\u003e wind up protecting their regional monopolies in local phone service, and \n\u003e if they also merge, the country will be on its way to having a national \n\u003e duopoly in local service: Verizon, in the East, and S.B.C., in the West. \n\u003e And these companies could dominate long distance as well, because of the \n\u003e poor health of the long-distance companies.\n\u003e \n\u003e The cable business also seems close to having two dominant national \n\u003e companies, AOL Time Warner and Comcast. Unlike the phone companies, they \n\u003e don\u0027t have to share their wiring with other companies and so can more \n\u003e fully control what material they allow to enter people\u0027s homes. As part \n\u003e of the complicated bargaining with interest groups that led to the 1996 \n\u003e Telecom Act, the limits on concentration in the radio industry were \n\u003e significantly loosened, and in the past six years the number of \n\u003e radio-station owners in the United States has been cut by twenty-five \n\u003e per cent; today, a large portion of local and national radio news \n\u003e programming is supplied by a single company, Westwood One, a subsidiary \n\u003e of Viacom.\n\u003e \n\u003e In this situation, many Democrats and liberals think, the F.C.C. should \n\u003e be hyperactive�the superhero of government regulation, springing to the \n\u003e rescue of both consumers and the communications industry. It should try \n\u003e to breathe life into the see-lecks and other new companies. It should \n\u003e disallow mergers, maintain ownership limits, and otherwise restrain the \n\u003e forces of concentration. It should use the government\u0027s money and muscle \n\u003e to get new technology�especially fast Internet connections�into the \n\u003e homes of people who can\u0027t afford it at current market prices. (An \n\u003e analogy that a lot of people in F.C.C. World make is between telecom and \n\u003e the Middle East: the Clinton people blame the bloodshed on the Bush \n\u003e people, because they disengaged when they came into office, and the Bush \n\u003e people blame it on the Clinton people, because they raised too many \n\u003e expectations and stirred too many passions.)\n\u003e \n\u003e But Michael Powell\u0027s F.C.C. has not been hyperactive. Powell has been \n\u003e conducting internal policy reviews and reforming the management of the \n\u003e F.C.C. and waiting for the federal courts and the Congress to send him \n\u003e signals. (In mid-September, Powell finally initiated a formal review of \n\u003e the F.C.C.\u0027s limits on media concentration.) This doesn\u0027t mean he has \n\u003e been inactive; rather, he has been active in a way that further \n\u003e infuriates his critics�in a manner that smoothly blends the genial and \n\u003e the provocative, he muses about whether the fundamental premises of \n\u003e F.C.C. World really make sense, while giving the impression that he\u0027s \n\u003e having the time of his life as chairman. At his first press conference, \n\u003e when he was asked what he was going to do about the \"digital \n\u003e divide\"�that is, economic inequality in access to the Internet�he said, \n\u003e \"You know, I think there is a Mercedes divide. I\u0027d like to have one and \n\u003e I can\u0027t afford one.\" At the National Cable \u0026 Telecommunications \n\u003e Association convention, in Chicago, Powell, following a troupe of \n\u003e tumblers to the stage, interrupted his walk to the podium to perform a \n\u003e somersault.\n\u003e \n\u003e \n\u003e Not long ago, I went to see Powell in his office at the F.C.C. Until \n\u003e 1998, when the commission moved to a new building in Southwest \n\u003e Washington, near the city\u0027s open-air fish market, F.C.C. World was at \n\u003e the western edge of downtown, where everybody would encounter everybody \n\u003e else at a few familiar restaurants and bars. Today, the F.C.C. building \n\u003e looks like the office of a mortgage company in a suburban office park. \n\u003e Even the chairman\u0027s suite, though large, is beige, carpeted, and \n\u003e fluorescent. Powell is a bulky man who wears gold-rimmed glasses and \n\u003e walks with a pronounced limp, the result of injuries he suffered in a \n\u003e jeep accident in Germany, in 1987, when he was an Army officer. Because \n\u003e of the accident, he left the Army and went to law school, where he \n\u003e became entranced with conservative ideas about regulation, particularly \n\u003e the idea that the government, rather than trying to correct the flaws of \n\u003e the market before the fact�\"prophylactically,\" as he likes to say�should \n\u003e wait till the flaws manifest themselves and then use antitrust \n\u003e litigation to fix them. He worked briefly at a corporate law firm, and \n\u003e then became a prot�g� of Joel Klein, the head of the antitrust division \n\u003e of the Clinton Justice Department and the man who led the government\u0027s \n\u003e legal case against Microsoft. (He was recently appointed chancellor of \n\u003e the New York public-school system.) It testifies to Powell\u0027s political \n\u003e skill that he is probably the only high official in the Bush \n\u003e Administration who not only served in the Clinton Administration but \n\u003e also maintains close ties to Bush\u0027s nemesis Senator John McCain, of \n\u003e Arizona. One of the things about Powell that annoy people is his \n\u003e enduring love of law school�\"It\u0027s sort of like a law-school study \n\u003e session over there,\" one Democratic former commissioner said. As if to \n\u003e confirm the charge, Powell, when I arrived, introduced me to four law \n\u003e students, summer interns at the commission, whom he\u0027d invited to sit in.\n\u003e \n\u003e I began by asking Powell whether he agreed with the founding assumptions \n\u003e of the F.C.C. For example, could private companies have apportioned the \n\u003e airwaves among themselves without the government being involved?\n\u003e \n\u003e \"I think we\u0027ll never know,\" Powell said. \"I don\u0027t think it\u0027s an \n\u003e automatically bad idea, the way some people will argue. Land is probably \n\u003e the best analogue. We don\u0027t seize all the land in the United States and \n\u003e say, \u0027The government will issue licenses to use land.\u0027 If my neighbor \n\u003e puts a fence one foot onto my property line, there\u0027s a whole body of law \n\u003e about what I can do about that, including whether I can tear it down. If \n\u003e a wireless company was interfering with another wireless company, it\u0027s a \n\u003e similar proposition. There are scholars who argue�indeed, the famous \n\u003e Ronald Coase treatise that won the Nobel Prize was about this�that \n\u003e spectrum policy is lunacy. The market could work this out, in the kinds \n\u003e of ways that we\u0027re accustomed to.\"\n\u003e \n\u003e Talking to Powell was fun. Unlike most high government officials, he \n\u003e doesn\u0027t seem to be invested in appearing dignified or commanding. He \n\u003e slumps in his chair and fiddles with his tie and riffs. He speaks in \n\u003e ironic air quotes. He\u0027s like your libertarian friend in college who \n\u003e enjoyed staying up all night asking impertinent rhetorical questions \n\u003e about aspects of life that everybody else takes for granted but that he \n\u003e sees as sentimental or illogical. After a while, I asked him whether he \n\u003e thought his predecessors\u0027 excitement about the 1996 Telecommunications \n\u003e Act had been excessive.\n\u003e \n\u003e \"I would start with a caveat,\" Powell said. \"Look, I can\u0027t fault those \n\u003e judgments in and of themselves, given the time and what people thought. \n\u003e They were not the only ones who were hysterical about the opportunities. \n\u003e But, frankly, I\u0027ve always been a little bit critical. First of all, \n\u003e anybody who works with the act knows that it doesn\u0027t come anywhere close \n\u003e to matching the hyperbole that was associated with it, by the President \n\u003e on down, about the kinds of things it\u0027s going to open up. I mean, I \n\u003e don\u0027t know what provisions are the information-superhighway provisions, \n\u003e or what provisions are so digitally oriented, or some of the things that \n\u003e were a big part of the theatre of its introduction. When one starts \n\u003e reading the details, one searches, often in vain, for these provisions. \n\u003e But, nonetheless, there was a rising dot-com excitement, and an Internet \n\u003e excitement, and people thought this was historic legislation, and it \n\u003e certainly was.\n\u003e \n\u003e \"But. We were sucking helium out of balloons, with the kinds of \n\u003e expectations that were being bandied around, and this is before the \n\u003e economy or the market even gets in trouble. It was a dramatically \n\u003e exaggerated expectation�by the leadership of the commission, by \n\u003e politicians, by the market itself, by companies themselves. It was a \n\u003e gold rush, and led to some very detrimental business decisions, ones \n\u003e that government encouraged by its policies, frankly. Everybody wanted to \n\u003e see numbers go up on the board.\"\n\u003e \n\u003e Powell began imitating an imagined true believer in the Telecom Act. \" \n\u003e \u0027I want to see ten competitors. Twenty competitors! I want to see \n\u003e thirty-per-cent market share. Fifty-per-cent market share! I want the \n\u003e Bells to bleed! Then we\u0027ll know we\u0027ve succeeded.\u0027 \" Now Powell returned \n\u003e to being Powell. \"I think that expectation was astonishingly \n\u003e unrealistic, in the short term. They wanted to see it while they\u0027re \n\u003e there. We were starting to get drunk on the juice we were drinking. And \n\u003e the market was getting drunk on the juice we were drinking. There\u0027s no \n\u003e question, we went too soon too fast. Too many companies took on too much \n\u003e debt too fast before the market really had a product, or a business model.\"\n\u003e \n\u003e How could the Telecom Act have been handled better? \"We could have \n\u003e chosen policies that were less hellbent on a single objective, and were \n\u003e slightly more balanced and put more economic discipline in the system,\" \n\u003e Powell said. \"Money chased what seemed like government-promised \n\u003e opportunity. The problem with that is there\u0027s a morning after, and we\u0027re \n\u003e in it. And the problem is there is no short fix for this problem. This \n\u003e debt is going to take years to bring down to a realistic level. In some \n\u003e ways, for short-term gain, we paid a price in long-term stability.\"\n\u003e \n\u003e Powell went on to say that it might have turned out differently if there \n\u003e had been a more \"reasonable\" level of investment. \"No, we wouldn\u0027t have \n\u003e every home in America with competitive choice yet�but we don\u0027t anyway. I \n\u003e don\u0027t think it\u0027s the remonopolization of telephone service. I don\u0027t buy \n\u003e that. The Bells will prosper, but did anybody believe they wouldn\u0027t? The \n\u003e part of the story that didn\u0027t materialize was that people thought so \n\u003e would MCI WorldCom and Sprint.\"\n\u003e \n\u003e Other local phone companies, he added, hadn\u0027t materialized as viable \n\u003e businesses, either, and they never might. \"Everybody\u0027s always saying, \n\u003e \u0027The regulators did this and this and this.\u0027 But, candidly, the story\u0027s \n\u003e quite the opposite. I think the regulators bent over backward for six \n\u003e years to give them a chance. Conditions don\u0027t get that good except once \n\u003e every thirty years, and it didn\u0027t happen. So, whatever the reason, we\u0027re \n\u003e looking at a WorldCom that\u0027s teetering. We\u0027re looking at a long-distance \n\u003e business that has had a rapid decline in its revenue base. A.T. \u0026 T. is \n\u003e breaking itself up. Sprint has struggled.\"\n\u003e \n\u003e Could the F.C.C. have done anything to make the long-distance companies \n\u003e stronger? \"At the F.C.C.? I think I\u0027ll just be blunt. My political \n\u003e answer? Yes, there\u0027s all kinds of things we can do at the margin to try \n\u003e to help. But I can\u0027t find thirty billion dollars for WorldCom somewhere. \n\u003e I can\u0027t mitigate the impacts of an accounting scandal and an S.E.C. \n\u003e investigation. Were I king, it would be wonderful, but I don\u0027t have \n\u003e those kinds of levers. I don\u0027t know whether anybody does. At some point, \n\u003e companies are expected to run themselves in a way that keeps them from \n\u003e dying.\" Powell couldn\u0027t have made it much clearer that he doesn\u0027t think \n\u003e it\u0027s his responsibility to do anything about the telecom crash. He has \n\u003e demonstrated his sure political touch by making accommodationist \n\u003e gestures�in August, for example, five months after disbanding the \n\u003e F.C.C.\u0027s Accounting Safeguards Division, Powell announced that he was \n\u003e appointing a committee to study accounting standards in the \n\u003e communications industry. But that shows that Powell is better at riding \n\u003e out the storm than, say, Harvey Pitt, his counterpart at the Securities \n\u003e and Exchange Commission, and does not mean that he plans to try to shore \n\u003e up the telecom industry.\n\u003e \n\u003e I asked Powell if it would bother him if, for most people, only one \n\u003e company provided cable television and only one provided local phone \n\u003e service. \"Yes,\" he said. \"It concerns us that there\u0027s one of each of \n\u003e those things, but let\u0027s not diminish the importance of there being one \n\u003e of each of those things. That still is a nice suite of communications \n\u003e capabilities, even if they aren\u0027t direct analogues of each other.\" \n\u003e Anyway, Powell said, before long the phone companies will be able to \n\u003e provide video service over their lines, and the cable companies will \n\u003e provide data service over their lines, so there will be more choice. \n\u003e \"So, yeah, we have this anxiety: we have one of everything. The question \n\u003e is, Does it stay that way?\"\n\u003e \n\u003e The concentration of ownership and the concentrated control of \n\u003e information did not appear to trouble Powell, either. He said that \n\u003e people confuse bigness, which brings many benefits, with concentration, \n\u003e which distorts markets. \"If this were just economics, it\u0027s easy. If you \n\u003e were to say to me, \u0027Mike, just worry about economic concentration,\u0027 we \n\u003e know how to do that�the econometrics of antitrust. I can tell you when a \n\u003e market\u0027s too concentrated and prices are going to rise. The problem is \n\u003e other dimensions, like political, ideological, sometimes emotional. Take \n\u003e the question of, if everybody\u0027s controlling what you see, the assumption \n\u003e there is that somehow there\u0027ll be this viewpoint, a monolithic \n\u003e viewpoint, pushed on you by your media and you won\u0027t get diversity. I \n\u003e think that\u0027s a possibility. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s nearly the possibility \n\u003e that\u0027s ascribed to it sometimes.\"\n\u003e \n\u003e Powell explained, \"Sometimes when we see very pointed political or \n\u003e parochial programming, it gets attacked as unfair. I see some of the \n\u003e same people who claim they want diversity go crazy when Rush Limbaugh \n\u003e exists. They love diversity, but somehow we should run Howard Stern off \n\u003e the planet. If it has a point of view, then it becomes accused of bias, \n\u003e and then we have policies like\"�here his tone went from ironic to \n\u003e sarcastic�\"the fairness doctrine, which seems to me like the antithesis \n\u003e of what I thought those people cared about. So when somebody is pointed \n\u003e and opinionated, we do all this stuff in the name of journalistic \n\u003e fairness and integrity or whatever, to make them balance it out.\"\n\u003e \n\u003e \n\u003e F.C.C. World abounds in theories about Michael Powell. One is that he \n\u003e can\u0027t make up his mind about how to address the crisis in the industries \n\u003e he regulates�so he talks (and talks and talks) flamboyantly about the \n\u003e market, in order to buy himself time. Another is that he\u0027s carrying \n\u003e water for the arbocks and the big cable companies. Another is that he is \n\u003e planning to run for the Senate from Virginia (or to be appointed \n\u003e Attorney General in a second Bush term), and doesn\u0027t want to do anything \n\u003e at the F.C.C. that would diminish his chances. Another is that he\u0027s \n\u003e waiting to move until there is more consensus on some course of action, \n\u003e so that he doesn\u0027t wind up going first and getting caught in the \n\u003e crossfire between the arbocks and the cable companies and the television \n\u003e networks. (In F.C.C. World, this is known as the Powell Doctrine of \n\u003e Telecom, after Colin Powell\u0027s idea that the United States should never \n\u003e commit itself militarily without a clear objective, overwhelming force, \n\u003e and an exit strategy.) And another is that he actually believes what he \n\u003e says, and thinks the telecommunications crash is natural, healthy, and \n\u003e irreversible, and more concentration would be just fine.\n\u003e \n\u003e \"This is why elections matter,\" Reed Hundt, who isn\u0027t happy about what \n\u003e has become of his Telecom Act, told me. It\u0027s true that the F.C.C.�much \n\u003e more than, say, the war in Afghanistan�is a case in which a Gore \n\u003e Administration would be acting quite differently from the Bush \n\u003e Administration. Consumers might have noticed the difference by now, but \n\u003e there\u0027s no question whether communications companies have noticed. The \n\u003e arbocks are doing better against their internal rivals than they would \n\u003e have done if Gore had won. Next election, they\u0027ll help the party that \n\u003e helped them. If the Republicans win, policy will tilt further in the \n\u003e arbocks\u0027 favor. If they lose, perhaps the arbocks\u0027 rivals�the \n\u003e long-distance companies and the telecommunications upstarts�with their \n\u003e friends now in power, will stage a comeback. America\u0027s present is not \n\u003e unrecognizably different from America\u0027s past.\n\u003e \n\u003e \n\n\n-- \nGregory Alan Bolcer, CTO  | work: +1.949.833.2800\ngbolcer at endeavors.com  | http://endeavors.com\nEndeavors Technology, Inc.| cell: +1.714.928.5476\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

People will go to \n\u003e see your movie as much to be entertained and informed as they will to \n\u003e express their malice and discontent towards not only the present \n\u003e regime in America, but also the corrupt, empty, shallow pantomime \n\u003e which cast them into power.\n\u003e\n\u003e In reality, today the voting that takes place via the act of \n\u003e consumption far outweighs the impact caused by people going to a booth \n\u003e and dimpling the appropriate chad, or some other such convoluted act \n\u003e of free democratic expression.\n\u003e\n\u003e Why?  Because in America, they believe in dollars.  Dollars don\u0027t lie. \n\u003e  In practise, they are the last frontier of truth in America, \n\u003e universally accepted as expressions of fear, desire, passion, and \n\u003e need.  Compared to the swing of the almighty buck, and Jeb Bush knows \n\u003e this, a hanging chad has only the nethermost meaning.\n\u003e\n\u003e Given that fact, I modestly propose an entirely new, though wholly \n\u003e logical, extension to the current democratic system in place in \n\u003e America:\n\u003e\n\u003e I propose we augment, and effectively replace, the electoral system \n\u003e with a political stock market.  We should accept that Politicians are \n\u003e entrepreneurs just like any other businessperson in America, and \n\u003e embrace this fact in building an economic system which truly reflects \n\u003e their intent.  A politician should issue a constant number of shares \n\u003e dependent upon his tenure in government.  Those shares should be \n\u003e traded on an open exchange, say the G.R.E.E.D. (short, of course, for \n\u003e the \"Global Realists\u0027 Electoral Exchange -- Democratic\").  Politicians \n\u003e we believe in will see their stocks rise higher as faith in their \n\u003e ability to maintain office grows.  As the truth about their embezzling \n\u003e campaign funds for weekend trips to Maui with their interns is \n\u003e revealed, of course, their fortunes will fall.\n\u003e\n\u003e This represents an opportunity for the market forces -- those same \n\u003e forces which you intend to harness to express your own personal \n\u003e protest -- to voice their opinion on the quality of America\u0027s \n\u003e governance during the intervening four years between elections.  \n\u003e Elections themselves will in effect become meaningless, as they are \n\u003e now, since their outcome will be influenced by the stock price of each \n\u003e and every congressman, senator, and presidential candidate.\n\u003e\n\u003e Just think of the coverage that could be given on MSNBC!  \"Strom \n\u003e Thurman (STROM: news - quotes) was down 15% today on fears that his \n\u003e latest heart operation will render him unable to attend Senate Armed \n\u003e Services committee meetings until November..\"  This would provide \n\u003e rejuvenating content to the econo-political news sector, which has \n\u003e found post-economic-bubble coverage to be both tiresome and \n\u003e deoressing.  The establishment of this new stock exchange would of \n\u003e course create jobs for newly unemployed (and governmentally retrained) \n\u003e IT systems engineers who could, after passing the electoral securities \n\u003e exam, become floor traders.\n\u003e\n\u003e This would also allow for a convenient and very public method by which \n\u003e candidates could raise capital in the public markets to support their \n\u003e multi-billion-dollar campaigns.  The requirement for the support of \n\u003e legions of spin doctors, permanent campaign managers, and investor \n\u003e relations personnel would also create jobs -- perhaps even a new \n\u003e practice for Ernst \u0026 Young, Arthur Anderson, et al.  Insider trading \n\u003e scandals and misleading revenue declarations would of course catch \n\u003e Martha Stewart as an unwitting beneficiary, thus spreading her \n\u003e influence to politics.\n\u003e\n\u003e Dividends, if there are any on record, at the close of a politician\u0027s \n\u003e career could be paid to current shareholders based on the holdings.  \n\u003e Pensions funds could provide the institutional investment support \n\u003e necessary to underpin even the biggest dogs among the Beltway set.  \n\u003e Union funds, brokerages, and even pump-and-dump houses could benefit \n\u003e from meteoric rises in conservative candidates running in the \n\u003e Southeast, and the Bush Governmet would be allowed to place Social \n\u003e Security bets where they really mattered.   investors who lose their \n\u003e retirement, life savings, and support could rest assured that they \n\u003e were indeed robbed by crooks rather than poor investors.\n\u003e\n\u003e Although there\u0027s no way to protect any of these for Worldcom-like \n\u003e crashes, ambitious, inspired, District Attorneys could file criminal \n\u003e suits against Candidates and Campaign Managers who underperform \n\u003e expectations, thus assuring investors that their logic was not faulty \n\u003e -- instead, they were merely defrauded by crooks and thieves.\n\u003e\n\u003e On the whole, I believe the system could work.  I could certainly work \n\u003e as well as our beloved securities trading industry and, given the \n\u003e American electoral system\u0027s success at effectively expressing the will \n\u003e of the people, it certainly couldn\u0027t do any worse...\n\u003e\n\u003e In the meantime, Mike, I think I\u0027ll go see your movie and try to \n\u003e depose the President.\n\u003e\n\u003e -Ian.\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e On Wednesday, October 9, 2002, at 03:53 PM, Michael Moore\u0027s Mailing \n\u003e List wrote:\n\u003e\n\u003e\u003e October 9, 2002\n\u003e\u003e\n\u003e\u003e My Film, \"Bowling for Columbine,\" Opens This Friday\n\u003e\u003e\n\u003e\u003e Dear friends, fans, and fellow evildoers:\n\u003e\u003e\n\u003e\u003e I am very happy and excited to tell you that this Friday, October 11, \n\u003e\u003e my\n\u003e\u003e new\n\u003e\u003e film, \"Bowling for Columbine,\" will open in New York and Los Angeles.\n\u003e\u003e\n\u003e\u003e It is, I promise, the last thing the Bushies want projected on the \n\u003e\u003e movie\n\u003e\u003e screens across America this week. The film is, first and foremost, a\n\u003e\u003e devastating indictment of the violence that is done in our name for \n\u003e\u003e profit\n\u003e\u003e and power -- and no one, in all the advance screenings I have \n\u003e\u003e attended, has\n\u003e\u003e left the theatre with anything short of rage. I truly believe this \n\u003e\u003e film has\n\u003e\u003e the potential to rock the nation and get people energized to do \n\u003e\u003e something.\n\u003e\u003e\n\u003e\u003e This is not good news for Junior and Company. Not when they are \n\u003e\u003e trying to\n\u003e\u003e drag us into another war. Not when a crazed sniper is exercising his\n\u003e\u003e constitutional right to own a high-powered rifle. Not when John \n\u003e\u003e Ashcroft is\n\u003e\u003e still prohibiting the FBI from looking through the gun background \n\u003e\u003e check\n\u003e\u003e files to see if any of the 19 hijackers or their associates purchased \n\u003e\u003e any\n\u003e\u003e weapons prior to 9/11 -- because THAT, we are told, would \"violate\" \n\u003e\u003e these\n\u003e\u003e terrorists\u0027 sacred Second Amendment rights!\n\u003e\u003e\n\u003e\u003e Yes, I believe this movie can create a lot of havoc -- but I will \n\u003e\u003e need ALL\n\u003e\u003e of you to help me do this. Are you game?\n\u003e\u003e\n\u003e\u003e Last February 5th, I wrote to tell you about a book I had written and \n\u003e\u003e how\n\u003e\u003e the publisher had decided to dump it because they were afraid to \n\u003e\u003e publish\n\u003e\u003e anything critical of Bush after 9/11. I appealed to you to save \n\u003e\u003e \"Stupid\n\u003e\u003e White Men\" from the shredder and to go out and buy it. I promised you \n\u003e\u003e would\n\u003e\u003e not regret it, and that the book would not only be a great read but an\n\u003e\u003e important organizing tool in gumming up the plans of George W. Bush.\n\u003e\u003e\n\u003e\u003e Within 24 hours, the book went to #1 on the Amazon best seller list. \n\u003e\u003e By the\n\u003e\u003e fifth day, the book was already into its 9th printing. The publisher \n\u003e\u003e was\n\u003e\u003e torn between its desire to kill the book or make a wad of money. \n\u003e\u003e Greed won\n\u003e\u003e out, and this Sunday the book enters its 31st week on the New York \n\u003e\u003e Times\n\u003e\u003e best seller list -- and its 32nd printing. This is all because of \n\u003e\u003e you, my\n\u003e\u003e crazy and loyal friends. You made this happen, against all the odds.\n\u003e\u003e\n\u003e\u003e Now I would like to ask you again to help me with my latest work, \n\u003e\u003e \"Bowling\n\u003e\u003e for Columbine.\" It\u0027s a movie that many critics have already called my \n\u003e\u003e best\n\u003e\u003e film to date. They may be right. It is certainly the most provocative \n\u003e\u003e thing\n\u003e\u003e I have ever done. I have spent three years on it and, I have to say, \n\u003e\u003e it\n\u003e\u003e cuts\n\u003e\u003e deeper, harder and funnier that anything I have given you so far.\n\u003e\u003e\n\u003e\u003e The movie opens this Friday in New York and Los Angeles, and then in \n\u003e\u003e 8 more\n\u003e\u003e cities next week. How it does in these first ten cities will determine\n\u003e\u003e whether or not the rest of the country gets to see it. That is the \n\u003e\u003e nutty\n\u003e\u003e way\n\u003e\u003e our films are released. If it doesn\u0027t have a big opening weekend, you \n\u003e\u003e can\n\u003e\u003e kiss the film good-bye. Therefore, this weekend, this film must be \n\u003e\u003e seen by\n\u003e\u003e millions of Americans. Can you help me make that happen?\n\u003e\u003e\n\u003e\u003e \"Bowling for Columbine\" is not a film simply about guns or school\n\u003e\u003e shootings.\n\u003e\u003e That is only the starting point for my 2-hour journey into the dark \n\u003e\u003e soul of\n\u003e\u003e a country that is both victim and master of an enormous amount of \n\u003e\u003e violence,\n\u003e\u003e both at home and around the world. With this movie I have broadened my\n\u003e\u003e canvas to paint a portrait of our nation at the beginning of the 21st\n\u003e\u003e century, a nation that seems hell-bent on killing first and asking\n\u003e\u003e questions\n\u003e\u003e later. It is a movie about the state sponsored acts of violence and\n\u003e\u003e terrorism against our own poor, and how we have created a culture of \n\u003e\u003e fear\n\u003e\u003e that is based on the racial dilemma we continue to ignore. And it\u0027s a\n\u003e\u003e devastating comedy.\n\u003e\u003e\n\u003e\u003e This film is going to upset some pretty big apple carts. No film has \n\u003e\u003e EVER\n\u003e\u003e said the things I am saying in \"Bowling for Columbine.\" I expect to be\n\u003e\u003e attacked. I expect certain theatres will not show it for fear of\n\u003e\u003e retribution. I expect that this movie will be a bitter pill for many \n\u003e\u003e to\n\u003e\u003e swallow.\n\u003e\u003e\n\u003e\u003e This is why I need your help. Movies live or die based on what \n\u003e\u003e happens at\n\u003e\u003e the box office the first weekend of its release. I need you, if you \n\u003e\u003e live in\n\u003e\u003e the New York or L.A. area, to go see \"Bowling for Columbine\" this \n\u003e\u003e Friday\n\u003e\u003e and\n\u003e\u003e Saturday -- and take as many family members and friends with you as\n\u003e\u003e possible. I guarantee you will not be disappointed -- and you may \n\u003e\u003e just see\n\u003e\u003e one of the best films of the year.\n\u003e\u003e\n\u003e\u003e Monday night in Times Square, \"Bowling for Columbine\" had its \n\u003e\u003e premiere. The\n\u003e\u003e crowd was amazing, as it was this past Saturday night at the Chicago \n\u003e\u003e Film\n\u003e\u003e Festival. The audience kept laughing or hooting or applauding so loud\n\u003e\u003e throughout the film that it was hard to hear the next line.\n\u003e\u003e\n\u003e\u003e The hate mail, the threats, the promises of retribution have already\n\u003e\u003e started\n\u003e\u003e to roll in to the distributor of this movie, United Artists. They are \n\u003e\u003e not\n\u003e\u003e backing down. But how long will this last?

A strong opening not only means that the rest of\n\u003e\u003e America\n\u003e\u003e will see this film, it means that a good number of people who see it \n\u003e\u003e are\n\u003e\u003e going to leave the film angry enough to get active and get involved. \n\u003e\u003e If it\n\u003e\u003e does poorly, I will have a difficult time finding the funding for the \n\u003e\u003e movie\n\u003e\u003e I want to make next -- a film about 9/11 and how Bush is using that \n\u003e\u003e tragic\n\u003e\u003e day as a cover for his right-wing agenda.\n\u003e\u003e\n\u003e\u003e Don\u0027t let that happen. Don\u0027t let the NRA have one more success by \n\u003e\u003e stopping\n\u003e\u003e the wider distribution of this movie. And, together, let us not remain\n\u003e\u003e silent in our opposition to Bush\u0027s phony war against Iraq.\n\u003e\u003e\n\u003e\u003e If you live in New York, you can see it at the Lincoln Plaza, the \n\u003e\u003e Sunshine\n\u003e\u003e and the Loews 19th St. In L.A., you can catch it at the Sunset 5, the\n\u003e\u003e Westwood Regent, Laemmle Sunset, Laemmle Towncenter (Encino), Landmark\n\u003e\u003e Rialto (Pasadena), and Regal University (Irvine).

(It is\namazing what one can achieve when mains power fails, long enough for\nUPS\u0027s to run out, and all that is left operational is the laptop and\nits battery supply...)\n\nFirst, I put in some defensive code into the area where the problem was\noccurring, so that if exmh is attempting (for any reason) to expand a\nsequence that isn\u0027t either a number, or a range of numbers (or a list of\nsuch things) it will simply ignore the trash, rather than giving a traceback.\nThis one solves the initial problem:\n\n--- mh.tcl.WAS\tThu Aug 22 21:15:06 2002\n+++ mh.tcl\tWed Aug 28 12:39:11 2002\n@@ -487,6 +487,10 @@\n     set seq {}\n     set rseq {}\n     foreach range [split [string trim $sequence]] {\n+\tif ![regexp {^[0-9]+(-[0-9]+)?$} $range] {\n+\t    # just ignore anything bogus\n+\t    continue;\n+\t}\n \tset parts [split [string trim $range] -]\n \tif {[llength $parts] \u003d\u003d 1} {\n \t    lappend seq $parts\n\n\nThat is amending proc MhSeqExpand which is where the error was occurring\nbefore (the code assumes that $range is either NNN or NNN-MMM so we should\nprobably make sure that\u0027s true - issue an error instead of just \"continue\"\nif you like, but I don\u0027t think an error is needed).\n\nBut that just allowed me to create a similar problem, in another place,\nby typing \"NNN-\" ... and rather than continue to fight fires like this,\nI thought I should think more about Brent\u0027s suggestion.   But rather than\nhave the selection code actually validate the input, which would mean it\nwould have to know what is to be valid, I decided that the right thing to\ndo is just to ignore any errors caused by invalid input, so I just stuck\na \"catch\" around the MsgShow that is processing the nonsense that the\nuser has typed.\n\nThis way, any later expansion to what MsgShow treats as legal (maybe\nallowing a sequence name, like \"prev\" or \"next\", or anything else can\nbe handled just there, without someone needing to remember that they have\nto go fix the selection processing code to allow it.\n\nBut, while I was playing there, I noticed something I never new before.\nIf you type \"66+\" the \"66\" changes to \"67\" (and so on, for each + that\nis typed).   I suspect that\u0027s perhaps an artifact of \"+ is bound to a\ndifferent function so it can be used as a toggle between changing the\ncurrent and the target folder, but it has to mean something if the current\ninput mode is a message number, so let it mean...\", but now I found it,\nI think its nice.    But if we can type 66+ why not 66- as well?  That\nkind of limitation bugs me, so I fixed it.\n\nAnd then I wondered about folders with names containing \u0027+\u0027 - the special\nuse of + as the toggle character means there\u0027s no way to type those from\nthe keyboard.   So I fixed that as well.   This makes two different\nrestrictions - there\u0027s no way to type a folder name that has a name\nbeginning with \u0027+\u0027 (but such a thing in MH would be a pain to use anyway,\nso I doubt this will bother anyone), and it is now only possible to\ntoggle between typing the current \u0026 target folder name when the name\nbeing typed is empty.   I\u0027m less happy about that part, but I think I\ncan live with it in order to allow folder names with +\u0027s in them to\nexist and be typed.\n\nThen, since I was there anyway, I decided to do something about another\nfeature that has always bugged me.   In \"normal\" keyboard mode, \u0027s\u0027 is\nthe key used to show a message.    But if you\u0027ve just typed 123, and\nthe FTOC is highlighting 123 as the current message, and you want to now\nshow that message, you can\u0027t type \u0027s\u0027, you have to type \\r instead.\nSo I \"fixed\" this one as well.   \"Fixed\" here is in quotes, as it assumes\nthat the keybinding for MsgShow is \u0027s\u0027, if you change that to something\nelse, it will remain \u0027s\u0027 in here.   I don\u0027t know enough tk/tcl to have it\ndiscover what key is bound to a function in the external world in order\nto bind the same one here.   \\r continues to work of course.\n\nAnd now I got started in fixing irritants in this code, I also made it\nclear the status line if you abort message/folder entry mode (^C or ^G).\nPreviously it used to leave the prompt sitting there until the next\nmessage appeared, which made it less than obvious that the keyboard had\nreverted to its usual bindings.\n\nIn any case, what follows is the patch that does all of that.   I believe\nthat if you apply this, then the one above is probably not needed, the\n\"catch\" around the \"MsgShow\" will hide the problem (I don\u0027t think we really\nneed to fix Brent\u0027s way of invoking it).   Or include it anyway, just\nfor completeness (I haven\u0027t run an exmh with the following patch, but not\nthe previous one, so I don\u0027t know for sure that all will be OK then).\n\nkre\n\n--- select.tcl.WAS\tThu Aug 22 21:15:07 2002\n+++ select.tcl\tWed Aug 28 13:36:17 2002\n@@ -49,9 +49,11 @@\n     bindtags $w [list $w Entry]\n     bind $w \u003cAny-Key\u003e\t{SelectTypein %W %A}\n     bind $w \u003cKey-plus\u003e\t{SelectToggle %W }\n+    bind $w \u003cKey-minus\u003e\t{SelectPrev %W }\n     bind $w \u003cspace\u003e\t{SelectComplete %W}\n     bind $w \u003cTab\u003e\t{SelectComplete %W}\n     bind $w \u003cReturn\u003e\t{SelectReturn %W}\n+    bind $w \u003cKey-s\u003e\t{SelectReturn %W %A}\n     bind $w \u003cBackSpace\u003e\t{SelectBackSpace %W}\n     bind $w \u003cControl-h\u003e\t{SelectBackSpace %W}\n     bind $w \u003cDelete\u003e\t{SelectBackSpace %W}\n@@ -72,7 +74,7 @@\n     append select(sel) $a\n     Exmh_Status \"$select(prompt) $select(sel)\"\n     if ![info exists select(folder)] {\n-\tMsg_Change $select(sel) noshow\n+\tcatch { Msg_Change $select(sel) noshow }\n     }\n }\n proc SelectBackSpace { w } {\n@@ -91,6 +93,10 @@\n proc SelectToggle {w} {\n     global select\n     if [info exists select(folder)] {\n+\tif {$select(sel) !\u003d \"\"} {\n+\t    SelectTypein $w +\n+\t    return\n+\t}\n \tset select(toggle) [list [lindex $select(toggle) 1] [lindex $select(toggle) 0]]\n \tset select(prompt) \"[lindex $select(toggle) 0] Folder:\"\n     } else {\n@@ -101,6 +107,18 @@\n     }\n     Exmh_Status \"$select(prompt) $select(sel)\"\n }\n+proc SelectPrev {w} {\n+    global select\n+    if [info exists select(folder)] {\n+\tSelectTypein $w \"-\"\n+    } else {\n+\tcatch {\n+\t    incr select(sel) -1\n+\t    Msg_Change $select(sel) noshow\n+\t}\n+        Exmh_Status \"$select(prompt) $select(sel)\"\n+    }\n+}\n proc SelectComplete { w } {\n     global select\n     if [info exists select(folder)] {\n@@ -126,9 +144,13 @@\n \tExmh_Status \"$select(prompt) $select(sel)\"\n     }\n }\n-proc SelectReturn { w } {\n+proc SelectReturn { w {a {}} } {\n     global select\n     if [info exists select(folder)] {\n+\tif {$a !\u003d {}} {\n+\t    SelectTypein $w $a\n+\t    return\n+\t}\n \tif [info exists select(match)] {\n \t    set select(sel) $select(match)\n \t    unset select(match)\n@@ -151,6 +173,7 @@\n \tunset select(folder)\n     }\n     $select(entry) configure -state disabled\n+    Exmh_Status \"\"\n     Exmh_Focus\n }\n proc SelectClear { w } {\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nExmh-workers mailing list\nExmh-workers@redhat.com\nhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-workers\n",

I\u0027m not sure why it is important that the\n \u003e first message in the sequence returned exists, but not necessarily any\n \u003e of the others, but I\u0027m sure glad it is, as MhSeqExpand gets called lots,\n \u003e and I don\u0027t know if I could cope if it were checking every file in the\n \u003e sequences it is looking at, all the time...\n\nThat was my thinking.  My recollection about the first message being valid\nis that the ftoc code wants to find that message to start its highlighting,\nfor example, or you are selecting a message to display.\n\n \u003e It may help to keep a list of the valid message numbers for the current\n \u003e folder (though that would then need to be verified against changes to the\n \u003e directory).   Does tcl have a directory read function?   I assume so...\n\nglob -nocomplain $mhProfile(path)/$folder *\nwill return an unsorted list of the directory\u0027s contents.\nBut the thought of keeping an in memory list of valid messages is not fun.\nExmh already maintains in-core lists of messages in sequences, which is\nalready pretty tricky\n\n \u003e Mh_Sequence also goes and rereads the files (.mh_sequences and the\n \u003e context file) but I\u0027m not sure how frequently that one is called.\n\nIn some places I maintain caches of files by checking their modify time,\nbut the sequence files are soo small that by the time you stat them to\ncheck their date stamp, you could just read them again.  Also, now that\nwe checkpoint message state on every message view, that file will change\nevery time.  In the old days exmh used to cache a bunch of state about\nthe folder.\n\n--\nBrent Welch\nSoftware Architect, Panasas Inc\nPioneering the World\u0027s Most Scalable and Agile Storage Network\nwww.panasas.com\nwelch@panasas.com\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nExmh-workers mailing list\nExmh-workers@redhat.com\nhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-workers\n",

But this adds messages to my other folders in the\n\u003e wrong order. When I\u0027m done, I\u0027d like to re-sort all the folders I\u0027ve\n\u003e changed.\n\nI don\u0027t understand.  How does sorting one folder add messages to\nother folders?  What do you use to sort?\n\nTom\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nExmh-users mailing list\nExmh-users@redhat.com\nhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-users\n\n",

I, at least,\nhave almost no problems with the choice of what gets pasted, or\nselected, that stuff (for me, if perhaps not users of some gnome variant,\nwhich appraently has been fixed anyway) all seems to work just fine.\n\nThe problem is that a button 1 click clears the selection (PRIMARY)\nwhere it shouldn\u0027t - the previous selection should only be cleared\nwhen there\u0027s something else to replace it (even if the highlighting\nof what is selected is removed).     Try this in any other ramdom\napplication (from xterm to netscape) and see how it works.  There\nnormally is *no* (mouse based) way to actually clear the primary\nselection (that is, set it to be a null string).\n\nThen, because of the \"if I get asked for the selection value, I will\nfind something\" behaviour, if you click (intending to set the insert\npoint, the way most other GUI\u0027s operate), and then paste, because the\nPRIMARY is clear, but exmh still owns the selection, because nothing\nelse has taken it, it does and finds some other ramdom stuff, from\neither the clipboard or cut buffer, which tends to be something that was\ndeleted back in the ancient past, and pastes that.\n\nThat behaviour, to me anyway, is the real issue.\n\nOnce that gets fixed, we can switch back to operating the normal\n\"select stuff, click at new insert point, paste\" mode of operation\nthat almost everyone expects to work (whether the \"select stuff\"\nis somewhere in one of the exmh windows, or elsewhere).\n\nkre\n\nps: this message is from my experience as a exmh user only, I\u0027ve never\nreally understood enough about X and selections to go gazing at that\npart of the code and see how it all really operates.\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nExmh-users mailing list\nExmh-users@redhat.com\nhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-users\n\n",

    "message": "\nThis is not an exmh problem, but an interaction between sendmail, Solaris and \nmh.\n\nYour sysadmin is wrong.  It is the responsibility of the receiving mail \nserver to escape lines beginning with \"From \" if they choose to turn on that \nfacility.  It is not the responsibility for email clients to cater to the \nstupid design of the unix mail spool, and Sun\u0027s even more stupid decision to \nrely on \"Content-length:\" instead of dealing with this problem.  Since mh is \nunaware of \"Content-length:\", rcvstore gags trying to parse messages from the \nspool.\n\nI had this same problem.  There are several ways to fix it:\n\n1)  Get your mail administrator to add the \"E\" flag to your sendmail.  This \nmeans you will never see a line beginning with \"From \".  Any such line will \nlook like \"\u003eFrom \".\n\n2)  There is a patch to mh to make it respect \"Content-length:\".  When I was \nhaving this problem, porting this patch to nmh was low on the priority list, \nthen nmh development stalled for a long time.  I doubt it has been done, but \nyou can check with the nmh list at nmh-workers@mhost.com to find out for sure.\n\n3)  You can learn to use procmail, invoking rcvstore directly instead of \nletting sendmail put your incoming mail into the spool.  This avoids the \nwhole issue.  rcvstore only deals with a single message at a time, and \neverything works.\n-- \nJim McMaster\nmailto:mcmasjc@tatanka.stortek.com\n\n\nIn message \u003c200210091657.g99GvDmX025433@life.ai.mit.edu\u003e, Jason Rennie said:\n\u003e \n\u003e When I receive a message that has a line starting with \"From \", it\u0027s\n\u003e broken into two messages.

It is the responsibility of the receiving mail\nJames\u003e server to escape lines beginning with \"From \" if they choose to turn\nJames\u003e on that facility.  It is not the responsibility for email clients to\nJames\u003e cater to the stupid design of the unix mail spool, and Sun\u0027s even more\nJames\u003e stupid decision to rely on \"Content-length:\" instead of dealing with\nJames\u003e this problem.  Since mh is unaware of \"Content-length:\", rcvstore gags\nJames\u003e trying to parse messages from the spool.\n\nAlso correct.  In fairness, though I cannot defend the Content-Length: header\nas I consider it brain damage in the extreme, Sun inherited this from AT\u0026T.\n\nJames\u003e Get your mail administrator to add the \"E\" flag to your sendmail.\nJames\u003e This means you will never see a line beginning with \"From \". Any such\nJames\u003e line will look like \"\u003eFrom \".\n\nSpecifically, you will need to find a line in /etc/mail/sendmail.cf that\nstarts with \"Mlocal\" such as:\n\n[4784] grep ^Mlocal /etc/mail/sendmail.cf\nMlocal,         P\u003d/usr/lib/mail.local, F\u003dlsDFMAw5:/|@qPSXfmnz9E, S\u003dEnvFromSMTP/HdrFromL, R\u003dEnvToL/HdrToL,\n[4785] \n\nand make sure that \u0027E\u0027 appears in the long list of flags following \"F\u003d\".\nIf your sys-admin uses m4 to generate sendmail.cf, and any good sys-admin\nshould, then here is the magic line for the .mc file:\n\nMODIFY_MAILER_FLAGS(`LOCAL\u0027, `+E\u0027)dnl\n\nJames\u003e You can learn to use procmail, invoking rcvstore directly instead of \nJames\u003e letting sendmail put your incoming mail into the spool.  This avoids\nJames\u003e the whole issue.  rcvstore only deals with a single message at a time,\nJames\u003e and everything works.\n\nAlso correct, though procmail per se is not needed, as other filters (such\nas slocal, which is part of the [n]mh distribution) do the trick just as well.\n\n-- John\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nExmh-users mailing list\nExmh-users@redhat.com\nhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-users\n\n",

I\u0027d like to humbly offer a tweak to alsa-driver.spec \nthat helps it build cleanly under such circumstances.  I recognize that \nfreshrpms.net packages are designed with standard Red Hat in mind, \nincluding a standard kernel RPM.  However, I hope that Matthias will \nconsider the tweak small enough to justify its incorporation.\n\nThe diff is attached below.  The first part of the diff contains a \nconditional that checks to see if the expected RPM is installed.  If it \nis, %{karch} is set as before and a new %{krpm} flag is set to 1.  If \nthe expected RPM is not installed, then %{karch} is instead set using \n\"uname -p\", while %{krpm} is left undefined.\n\nThe second part of the diff is simpler.  We only require that \nkernel-source be installed if the kernel itself came from an RPM.

As usual the result is\nthat I\u0027ve spent much more time repackaging the darn thing than actually\ntesting the functionalities or trying to hear the great sound quality\npeople seem to think it outputs... but hey, some of you will benefit from\nthat, right? ;-)\n\nI\u0027ve got the whole thing working on a Valhalla system, but the packages\nshould easily install or at least recompile on Enigma, Limbo/(null) and\nmaybe others, who knows ;-)\n\nHere are quick instructions for those of you that wish to try it out :\n- Recompile the \"alsa-driver\" source rpm for your running kernel\n  (you can install the binary package if you\u0027re using the i686 2.4.18-10)\n- Install this \"alsa-driver\" package\n- Install the \"alsa-libs\" package\n- Install the \"alsa-utils\" package\n\nNow go to this URL and find out what you need to change in your\n/etc/modules.conf file to replace the default OSS driver loading :\nhttp://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/\n(very complete and very good documentation!)\nHopefully you\u0027ll see that your card *is* supported ;-)\n\nReboot, or remove by hand your current sound modules (you\u0027ll probably need\nto stop many applications to free the sound resource...) \"by hand\" and\ninsert the new ones. If all is well you\u0027ve got ALSA working! (\"dmesg\" to\ncheck is a good idea), you now just need to adjust the volume levels with\ne.g. aumix and alsamixer because everything is muted by default.\n\nWith \"aplay\" you can already test files to see if you hear anything. You\ncan also install the XMMS plugin (seems to make my XMMS segfault on exit...\nhmmm, but maybe it\u0027s another plugin) to listen to your good ol\u0027 mp3\nfiles... that\u0027s it!\n\nIt really isn\u0027t complicated, and has never been from what I see. The only\nthing I disliked was to have to install from source... but as I can\u0027t\nimagine myself doing that ;-) I\u0027ve repackaged everything cleanly. Even the\n/dev entries are included in the rpm package (and *not* created by an ugly\n%post script, I insist!) and seamlessly integrate into the /etc/makedev.d\nstructure. There are also a few other noticeable differences with the\ndefault provided ALSA spec files, for example I\u0027ve split alsa-lib\u0027s\ndevelopment files into an alsa-lib-devel package and included static\nlibraries... there are others of course (oh yes, the kernel version against\nwhich the \"alsa-driver\" package is compiled gets neatly integrated in the\nrpm release, so does the architecture!).\n\nI\u0027m open to any comments or suggestions about these packages!\n\nDownload :\nhttp://ftp.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/testing/alsa/\n\nCurrent spec files :\nhttp://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-driver/alsa-driver.spec\nhttp://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-lib/alsa-lib.spec\nhttp://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-utils/alsa-utils.spec\n(All others, patches etc. : http://freshrpms.net/builds/ )\n\nMatthias\n\nPS: As an extra bonus, I\u0027ve also recompiled xine with alsa support!

This story is also immortalised\nin an old Dublin song, which in turn was mentioned in a Pogues track.  Billy\nwas a legless beggar in the alleys of Stoneybatter and Grangegorman (where I\nnow live) during the 18th century, who discovered a new, but not entirely\nlegal, way to make money.\n\nBlogEnd: \nLinkText: Billy in the Bowl\n\nFrom:         daev \u003chellshaw@fringeware.com\u003e\nSubject:      The Case of the Stoneybatter Strangler\n\nA story of my new neighbourhood...\n\n\nThe Irish Digest July 1964\n\n\nThe Case of the Stoneybatter Strangler\n\nThe handsome, deformed Billy in the Bowl evolved a plan to rob his donors.\nThen, one night, he made the biggest mistake of his life \n\nDUBLIN in the eighteenth century was noted for two things - the\narchitectural beauty of its public buildings and the large number of\nbeggars who sought alms in its maze of streets and lanes.  Many of these\nbeggars relied on visitors and the gentry for their coin, but there was one\nwho campaigned among the working class.  This was \"Billy In The Bowl\"\n\nThe strange appellation was derived from the fact that Billy\u0027s sole means\nof transport was a large bowl-shaped car with wheels.  Seated in this \"\nbowl \", the beggar would propel himself along by pushing against the ground\nwith wooden plugs, one in each hand.\n\nBilly\u0027s unusual means of conveyance was vitally necessary, as he had been\nborn without legs.  Nature, however, had compensated for this by endowing\nhim with powerful arms and shoulders and, what was most important, an\nunusually handsome face.\n\nThis was Billy\u0027s greatest asset in his daily routine of separating\nsympathetic passers-by from their small change.\n\nThe cunning young beggar would wait at a convenient spot on one of the many\nlonely roads or lanes which were a feature of eighteenth century\nGrangegorman and Stoneybatter, until a servant girl or an old lady would\ncome along.\n\nHe would then put on is most attractive smile which, together with his\nblack curly hair, never failed to halt the females.  The fact that such a\nhandsome young man was so terribly handicapped physically always evoked pity.\n\n\"Billy in the Bowl\", however, wasn\u0027t satisfied with becoming the daily\nowner of a generous number of small coins; what his greed demanded were\nsubstantial sums of money.  The more he managed to get the more he could\nindulge in his pet vices - gambling and drinking.\n\nAs a result the beggar evolved a plan to rob unsuspecting sympathisers.\nThe first time lie put his plan into operation was on a cold March evening\nas dusk, was falling.  The victim was a middle aged woman who was passing\nthrough Grangegorman Lane on her way to visit friends in Queen Street - on\nDublin\u0027s North Quays.\n\nWhen Billy heard the woman\u0027s footsteps, he hid behind some bushes in a\nditch which skirted the lane.  As his unsuspecting victim drew close, the\nbeggar moaned and shouted, and cried out for help.\n\nTrembling with excitement, the woman dashed to the spot where Billy lay\nconcealed.  She bent down to help the beggar out of the ditch, when two\npowerful arms closed around her throat and pulled her into the bushes.\n\nIn a few minutes it was all over.  The woman lay in a dead faint, and Billy\nwas travelling at a fast rate down the lane in his \" bowl \", his victirn\u0027s\npurse snug in his coat pocket.  An hour after the robbery the woman was\nfound in a distracted condition, but failed to give a description of her\nassailant.  And, as \"Billy in the Bowl\" had figured, nobody would suspect a\ndeformed beggar.\n\nAgain and again the beggar carried out his robbery plan, always shifting\nthe place of attack to a different part of Grangegorman or  Stoneybatter.\n\nOn one occasion \" Billy in \"the Bowl \" tried his tactics on a sturdy\nservant girl who put up such a vigorous resistance that he was forced to\nstrangle her.  The incident became known as the 11 Grangegorman Lane Murder\nand caused a great stir.\n\nHundred.s flocked to the scene of the crime and for a couple of months\n\"Billy in the Bowl\" was forced to desert his usual haunts.  Around this\nperiod, Dublin\u0027s first-ever police force was been mobilised, and the first\ncase they were confronted with was the Grangegorman lane murder.\n\nMonths passed and  \"Billy in the Bowl\" reverted once again to his old\npasttime.  A number of young servant girls were lured into ditches and\nrobbed, and the police were inundated with so many complaints that a\nnightly patrol was placed on the district.  But the beggar still rolled\nalong in his \"bowl\" pitied and unsuspected.  Then came the night that\nfinished Billy\u0027s career of crime.\n\nTwo stoudy built female cooks, trudging back to their places of employment\nafter a night out in the city, were surprised and not a little shocked to\nhear shouts for help.  Rushing over, they came upon a huddled figure in the\nditch.\n\nBilly, thinking there was only one woman, grabbed one of the cooks and\ntried to pull her into the ditch.  She proved much too strong for him,\nhowever) and while resisting tore \u0027at his face with her sharp finger-nails.\n\nMeanwhile, her companion acted with speed and daring.  Pulling out her\nlarge hatpin she made .for the beggar, and plunged the pin into his right eye.\n\nThe screams and howls of the wounded beggar reverberated throughout the\ndistrict and brought people dashing to the scene.  Among them was a member\nof the nightly police patrol who promptly arrested the groaning Billy.\n\n\"Billy in the Bowl\" was tried and sentenced for robbery with violence, but\nthey could never prove it was he who had strangled the servant girl.  The\nGrangegorman-Stoneybatter district became once again a quiet, attractive\nDublin suburb where old ladies strolled, and carefree servant girls laughed\nand giggled as they wended their way home at night.\n\n\n\ndaev\n\n_______________________________\nRev.

Habeas runs something called the \n\"Habeas Infringers List\", and if you use their trademark without \ntheir permission, you\u0027ll end up on it.  Then, when you send spam \nwith the misappropriated header, users of SA (2.40 supports \nthis) will tag your mail as spam, rather than let it through. \nThis may be done independantly of your IP address, so be \nprepared to constantly change domain names, and move your \nservers as fast as you send spam.\n\nAlso, that little haiku is a copyrighted work, so not only CAN \nHabeas sue, they MUST sue to protect their copyright. And since \nit\u0027s a trademark as well, that\u0027s a double-whammy. Habeas has \nsome pretty high-powered legal people, who will gladly go to \ntown on violators.\n\nThe whole point here is to give them the legal leverage they \nneed to put spammers out of business, and not only block mail \nfrom them, but allow through the things that really AREN\u0027T spam.\n\n--B\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by: Jabber - The world\u0027s fastest growing \nreal-time communications platform!

The spam \noften appears to originate there because it\u0027s coming from open \nhttp, or squid proxy servers.  It\u0027s hosted there because these \nspammers are now persona-non-grata on all US ISPs.

Ralsky is a guy who even gives interviews to \nthe news media.  If you can connect a specific corpus of spam to \nhim, his street address is well known. Ralsky is a prime \ncandidate for lawsuits in any state with an anti-spam law. \nThomas Cowles is another long-time spammer, but last I heard \nhe\u0027d been jailed for stealing computer equipment from his \nbusiness partner, Eddy Marin (also a long time spammer (You\u0027ve \nheard of PopLaunch, right?)\n\n\u003e  - Spammers do not always remember to include contact information!

Seems she had an open \nfile-share on her laptop, and when she forged the wrong domain, \nthe real owner hacked in and posted all her private information \non a website. Oh, look, it\u0027s still there, including the nude \nphotos:\n\nhttp://belps.freewebsites.com/\n\nI recall this well, because the SEC was VERY interested in \nconfirming the validity of the information found online.  There \nwere some \"interesting\" conversations. This summer, the SEC \nreleased the following:\n\nhttp://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/33-8113.htm\n\nYes, the investigation took two years, but the financial penalty \nfor operating a pump-and-dump scam isn\u0027t small.

Yes, some attorneys general have prosecuted blatant\npyramid schemes, and ISPs have won some theft of service suits, but the\nvast majority of spammers go forward with out any legal hassles.  So, I\ncan\u0027t understand how Daniel can assert that you can\u0027t track spammers\ndown when it\u0027s never really been tried.  We can subpoena the records of\nthe business they spammed on behalf of.  We can subpoena the records of\nthe ISP that provided them service, and of the credit card they used for\nthe whack-a-mole accounts.  We can use private investigators.  Yes,\nthese people are often lowlifes (chickenboners).  But, they\u0027re not\nsecret agents.  They\u0027re just trying to make a buck, and Habeas\u0027 whole\nbusiness is about finding them and putting them out of business\n\nHabeas has the incentive to pursue spammers (that use our warrant mark)\nin a way that no one ever has had before.  Given that our whole business\nplan relies on Habeas becoming synonymous with \"not spam\", I can\u0027t\nunderstand why you would assume ahead of time that we will be\nunsuccessful, plan for that failure, and in so doing, remove the\npotential of success, which is anti-spam filters like SA acting on the\nHabeas warrant mark.\n\nDaniel, it\u0027s easy enough for you to change the Habeas scores yourself on\nyour installation.  If Habeas fails to live up to its promise to only\nlicense the warrant mark to non-spammers and to place all violators on\nthe HIL, then I have no doubt that Justin and Craig will quickly remove\nus from the next release.  But, you\u0027re trying to kill Habeas before it\nhas a chance to show any promise.\n\nAt the end of the day, SpamAssassin is like the Club, in that it\nencourages thieves (spammers) to just go after the next car (those\nwithout SA) rather than yours.  Habeas can play the role of LoJack (the\ntransmitter), in enabling the apprehension of thieves so that they don\u0027t\nsteal any more cars.

And what do you mean by \"unbreakable\"?\n\nYou need to be far more explicit about the problem which you wish to\nsolve, and about the constraints involved.\n\nSome general points:\n\n1. For a conventional \"CD key\" system, where the actual CDs are\nmass-produced (where you have many identical CDs), and the entire\nsystem has to work offline, you cannot solve the problem of valid keys\nbeing \"traded\" (e.g. included along with bootleg copies of the\nproduct).\n\nIf there\u0027s an online element involved, you can \"tie\" keys to a\nspecific hardware configuration, as is done (AFAIK) for Windows XP\u0027s\n\"product activation\".\n\n2. Anything which uses a symmetric cipher (or hash) is bound to be\nvulnerable to reverse engineering of the validation routines within\nthe executable.\n\n3. Ultimately, any software mechanism will be vulnerable to\n\"cracking\", i.e. modifying the software to disable or circumvent the\nvalidation checks.\n\nThis can only be prevented by the use of trusted hardware (e.g. a\nPalladium-style system).\n\nMost significantly, the data must be supplied in a form which is only\naccessible by that hardware. If anyone can get at the data in a\nmeaningful (i.e. unencrypted) form, they can extract the useful parts\nand discard the rest (i.e. any associated protection mechanisms).\n\nIOW, you have to \"keep the genie in the bottle\" at all times. If the\ndata can be got at just once (even if it requires the use of dedicated\nhardware such as a bus analyser), it can then be duplicated and\ndistributed without limit.\n\n-- \nGlynn Clements \u003cglynn.clements@virgin.net\u003e\n",

But, in all probability: no, it isn\u0027t usually worth it. So, it\ncomes down to how difficult you want to make the cracker\u0027s job.\n\nIf the product requires occasional authentication, simple copying\nwon\u0027t work; the product has to be cracked. In which case, the issue is\nwhether you\u0027re actually going to enter into battle with the crackers,\nor just make sure that it isn\u0027t trivial.\n\nA lot of it comes down to your customer base. Teenage kids tend to be\nmore concerned about cost and less concerned about viruses/trojans,\nand so more willing to use warez. Fortune-500 corporations are likely\nto view matters differently.\n\n\u003e Does it really make it more secure ?\n\nYes; software techniques will only get you so far. Actually, the same\nis ultimately true for hardware, but cracking hardware is likely to\nrequire resources other than just labour.\n\nAlmost (?) anything can be reverse engineered. But it may be possible\nto ensure that doing so is uneconomical.\n\n\u003e Look at the DVDs.\n\nIIRC, CSS was cracked by reverse-engineering a software player; and\none where the developers forgot to encrypt the decryption key at that.\n\n-- \nGlynn Clements \u003cglynn.clements@virgin.net\u003e\n",

Can you have a Pine message id in the same header\n\u003e with an Outlook Express one or a Mutt User-Agent?\n\nYes, this is a big bonus of meta rules (new in 2.40); we can now\ne.g. check for an Outlook-style forwarded message, and not give\nit negative points unless it contains other signs of being from\nOutlook.\n\n\u003e I think the headers should be paid special attention to.

Tone down the\n\u003e negative scores and ding them extra for any obvious forgeries.\n\nWhen we get more (good) \"nice\" tests, the GA will assign lower\nscores to them.

    "message": "\nThis is not directly SpamAssassin related, but more of a general\ndealing-with-SPAM issue.\n\nWhat is the best way to deal with SPAM during the SMTP transaction?\nThere are domains and addresses that I know are SPAM at the \u0027MAIL\nFROM\u0027 and can deal with at the SMTP level. I have been, and I think\nmost people, respond with a 5.7.1 code, a \"permanent\" error. That\npretty much means, \"Don\u0027t bother to try from that address again,\nyou\u0027ll get the same error.\" People often add cathartic messages to\naccompany the 550 like, \"Spammers must die.\"\n\nBut this might not be the best way to go. You are telling the spammers\nthat you are on to them. This may cause them to try other methods to\nget around your blocks. Is it perhaps better to blackhole the mail?\nThat is, act like everything is OK during the SMTP transaction, but\nthen just drop the mail into the bitbucket. (This is generally how\nSpamAssassin works since almost everyone uses it after the SMTP\ntransaction has completed successfully.) Spammer thinks everything is\ngoing fine and has no reason to try new methods.\n\nThen there is a third possibility. Instead of returning a 550 code\nindicating you\u0027re on to the spammer, fake a 5.1.1 response which is\nsaying \"mailbox does not exist.\" This would be in the hopes that some\nspammers out there actually remove names reported as non-existent from\ntheir lists. I know, a slim hope, but even if only a few do, it can\nlower the incidence.\n\nSo, what are the arguments for each? Do spammers even look at _any_ of\nthe bounce messages they get? The volume of bounces must be\nhuge. Personally, I\u0027m starting to think blackholes are the way to\ngo... But sending back that \"Spammer die, die, die,\" or stock \"Access\nDEE-NIED!\" (my ephasis added) message can be pretty satisfying. ;)\n-- \nCrist J.

The vast majority (all but, say, 10) have never\never existed.  Yet, spammers would semi-continuously connect, try to\ndeliver mail to 40 of them, disconnect, connect again, try delivering\nto 40 more...  over and over, they kept getting \"User unknown\" until I\ngot around to making them spamtraps.\n\nSo my evidence would suggest that it depends who you\u0027re dealing with. :)\nIf your \"business\" is to sell address lists to people who would then spam,\nit\u0027s in your best interest to never clean your list.  Therefore you can\nsay \"10 million email addresses\" and not technically be lying, even if\nthe majority of them don\u0027t work.\n\nIf you\u0027re a spammer, you\u0027d want to know who doesn\u0027t actually exist, but\nthen again you don\u0027t really care: you probably want to relay through\nsomeone so it\u0027s harder to trace you, if you could you\u0027d send to every\nemail address available, you don\u0027t want to setup a valid bounce address\nbecause again it\u0027s easy to trace you.\n\nSo I would say this, if you technically spam people but actually think\nyou\u0027re running a legit service, you probably really do have a way of\nopting out (even though the user didn\u0027t opt in) and you probably don\u0027t\nrelay, and you probably pay attention to bounces.\n\nEveryone else doesn\u0027t really care.\n\n\nThat\u0027s my view anyway. :)\n\n--\u003d20\nRandomly Generated Tagline:\n\"Now you can do that thing with your hands...

Lower numbers are more preferred than higher\n   ones.  If there are multiple destinations with the same preference\n   and there is no clear reason to favor one (e.g., by recognition of an\n   easily-reached address), then the sender-SMTP MUST randomize them to\n   spread the load across multiple mail exchangers for a specific\n   organization.\n[...]\n   If it determines that it should relay the message without rewriting\n   the address, it MUST sort the MX records to determine candidates for\n   delivery.  The records are first ordered by preference, with the\n   lowest-numbered records being most preferred.  The relay host MUST\n   then inspect the list for any of the names or addresses by which it\n   might be known in mail transactions.  If a matching record is found,\n   all records at that preference level and higher-numbered ones MUST be\n   discarded from consideration.  If there are no records left at that\n   point, it is an error condition, and the message MUST be returned as\n   undeliverable.  If records do remain, they SHOULD be tried, best\n   preference first, as described above.\n\n--\u003d20\nRandomly Generated Tagline:\n\"Now let\u0027s say I like sheep...

From past results,\nwhat\u0027s needed are one or more of the below:\n        A. Determine mutational parameters by adapted-scores themselves,\n           with variation on a per-original score basis; ideally, allow\n           for having \"correlated\" mutations - in other words, have a\n           mechanism in place for trying out changes to a bunch of scores at\n           once, with them all moving about the same amount (albeit possibly\n           in different directions) - one means to do this is found in the\n           \"Evolutionary Strategies\" of Schwefel;\n        B. Adapt the probability of a mutation taking place depending on how\n           well previous mutation tries have done - if more than about a\n           fifth of the new \"individuals\" are doing about as well as, or\n           better than, the parental generation, then mutate more\n           parameters; if less than a fifth of them are doing about as well\n           as, or better than, the parental generation, then mutate less\n           parameters.\n\n        -Allen\n\n\n\n------- You are receiving this mail because: -------\nYou are the assignee for the bug, or are watching the assignee.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek\nWelcome to geek heaven.\nhttp://thinkgeek.com/sf\n_______________________________________________\nSpamassassin-devel mailing list\nSpamassassin-devel@lists.sourceforge.net\nhttps://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-devel\n\n",

Use of $Config is gradually being removed, thankfully.

Perl does not\nknow about the existence of /usr/share or /etc.  Used to use /usr/lib/perl5\nfor storing rules, and it was actually *much worse* than it is now. So\nwe need an out-of-band way to tell SA where to find this stuff. that\u0027s\nthe problem!\n\n3. try \"perl Makefile.PL \u003c /dev/null\" to allow bots to build it.\n\nI think I might be missing some details of what you\u0027re peeved about,\nthough... could you elaborate specifically?\n\n\n\n\n------- You are receiving this mail because: -------\nYou are the assignee for the bug, or are watching the assignee.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek\nWelcome to geek heaven.\nhttp://thinkgeek.com/sf\n_______________________________________________\nSpamassassin-devel mailing list\nSpamassassin-devel@lists.sourceforge.net\nhttps://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-devel\n\n",

    "message": "\nhttp://www.hughes-family.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id\u003d1046\n\n\n\n\n\n------- Additional Comments From spamassassin-contrib@msquadrat.de  2002-10-03 13:57 -------\n\u003e I\u0027ve thought about this and PM_FILTER needs to die. I\u0027ve now tried  \n\u003e multiple ways to make it just transparently work on 5.00503 and failed.  \n\u003e If anyone has any bright ideas please jump in. \n\u003e  \n\u003e You see anyone upgrading from the CPAN shell will get a failure on the line: \n\u003e  \n\u003e    use ExtUtils::MakeMaker 5.45; \n \nQuite some modules from CPAN do have a line like this nowadays (I think or \nread so somewhere, respectively). And the Perl error message is very clear: \n\"ExtUtils::MakeMaker version 5.45 required--this is only version 5.4302 at \nMakefile.PL line 2.\" \n \n\u003e Because it never gets chance to reach a \"WriteMakefile\" line with a  \n\u003e PREREQ_PM \u003d\u003e { ExtUtils::MakeMaker \u003d\u003e 5.45 } option. So the CPAN shell  \n\u003e can\u0027t automatically upgrade this module. I cannot think of any way  \n\u003e around this. \n \nI could think of a solution: We could remove the \"use\" line and add the \nversion to PREREQ_PM. After WriteMakefile() we could add the lines \n  require ExtUtils::MakeMaker; \n  ExtUtils::MakeMaker-\u003eVERSION(5.45); \nto do per hand what \u0027use ExtUtils::MakeMaker 5.45\u0027 does automagically; `perl \nMakefile.PL` will die with a \"Uncaught exception from user code: \nExtUtils::MakeMaker version 5.45 required--this is only version 5.4302 at \nMakefile.PL line 103.\" there but we\u0027ve got a Makefile. But I don\u0027t know if \nCPAN will run the make anyway... \n \n\u003e To add insult to injury, the PM_FILTER part gets run during pm_to_blib,  \n\u003e which would be fine, except ExtUtils::MakeMaker doesn\u0027t let you write a  \n\u003e MY::pm_to_blib - it\u0027s non-overridable! So even though we could  \n\u003e potentially copy the 5.45 ExtUtils::Install::pm_to_blib code somewhere  \n\u003e into the spamassassin codebase (I tried that first), we can\u0027t cause the  \n\u003e Makefile to call our code :-( \n \nWe could call the preprocessor on install time. That\u0027s not a very clean \napproach but could work. \n \nWe can also overwrite pm_to_blib in the Makefile directly per postamble. We \nalready have a useless line \"pm_to_blib: spamassassin doc/.made\" there. Adding \nsome commands in this section gives some make warnings (\"Makefile:933: \nwarning: overriding commands for target `pm_to_blib\u0027 Makefile:877: warning: \nignoring old commands for target `pm_to_blib\u0027\") but does work. Not a very good \nsolution either. \n \n\u003e So I\u0027m *strongly* against the current use of ExtUtils::MakeMaker 5.45  \n\u003e usage (if this were an Apache project this would be my veto vote), and  \n\u003e really hope we can find another way. \n \nThe \"use MakeMaker::...\" error message is IMHO quite clear, so I think it\u0027s ok \nto require the user to do a manual update of ExtUtils::MakeMaker before the SA \ninstallation. But that\u0027s just my opinion ;-) \n \nI\u0027ll ask on makemaker@perl.org for the best solution. They should know. \n\n\n\n------- You are receiving this mail because: -------\nYou are on the CC list for the bug, or are watching someone who is.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek\nWelcome to geek heaven.\nhttp://thinkgeek.com/sf\n_______________________________________________\nSpamassassin-devel mailing list\nSpamassassin-devel@lists.sourceforge.net\nhttps://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-devel\n\n",

I think this should be split up into different\nnumbers of trailing digits, so that rules with different S/O ratios can\nget different scores.  So I\u0027ve made test rules that look from From\nnames that end with two, three, four, or five digitis, and one for six or\nmore digitis; I also put in a test rule that looks for Froms that end in a\nsingle digit, just the sake of completeness.\n\nHere is what I got:\n\nOVERALL%   SPAM% NONSPAM%     S/O    RANK   SCORE  NAME\n  15113     4797    10316    0.32    0.00    0.00  (all messages)\n100.000   31.741   68.259    0.32    0.00    0.00  (all messages as %)\n  1.244    3.877    0.019    1.00    0.64    0.01  T_FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS6\n  0.576    1.459    0.165    0.90    0.43    0.01  T_FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS5\n  4.982   10.694    2.326    0.82    0.38    0.01  T_FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS4\n  3.434    6.337    2.084    0.75    0.35    0.01  T_FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS3\n  8.979   12.383    7.396    0.63    0.30    0.01  T_FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS2\n  8.847    6.817    9.791    0.41    0.22    0.01  T_FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS1\n\nI should note that I get rather bad S/O\u0027s for FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS, probably\nbecause so much of my corpus is made up of Yahoo!

These messages could end up being falsely (or incorrectly) reported\n\u003e    to Razor, DCC, Pyzor, etc.  Certain RBLs too.  I don\u0027t think the\n\u003e    results for these distributed tests can be trusted in any way,\n\u003e    shape, or form when running over a public corpus.\n\nI\u0027ll note that in the README.\n\n\u003e 2. These messages could also be submitted (more than once) to projects\n\u003e    like SpamAssassin that rely on filtering results submission for GA\n\u003e    tuning and development.\n\u003e The second problem could be alleviated somewhat by adding a Nilsimsa\n\u003e signature (or similar) to the mass-check file (the results format used\n\u003e by SpamAssassin) and giving the message files unique names (MD5 or\n\u003e SHA-1 of each file).\n\nOK; maybe rewriting the message-ids will help here, that should allow\nus to pick them out.  I\u0027ll do that.\n\n\u003e 3. Spammers could adopt elements of the good messages to throw off\n\u003e    filters.  And, of course, there\u0027s always progression in technology\n\u003e    (by both spammers and non-spammers).\n\u003e The third problem doesn\u0027t really worry me.\n\nnah, me neither.\n\n\u003e These problems (and perhaps others I have not identified) are unique\n\u003e to spam filtering.  Compression corpuses and other performance-related\n\u003e corpuses have their own set of problems, of course.\n\u003e \n\u003e In other words, I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any replacement for having\n\u003e multiple independent corpuses.  Finding better ways to distribute\n\u003e testing and collate results seems like a more viable long-term solution\n\u003e (and I\u0027m glad we\u0027re working on exactly that for SpamAssassin).  If\n\u003e you\u0027re going to seriously work on filter development, building a corpus\n\u003e of 10000-50000 messages (half spam/half non-spam) is not really that\n\u003e much work.  If you don\u0027t get enough spam, creating multi-technique\n\u003e spamtraps (web, usenet, replying to spam) is pretty easy.  And who\n\u003e doesn\u0027t get thousands of non-spam every week?  ;-)\n\nYep.  The primary reason I released this, was to provide a good, big\ncorpus for academic testing of filter systems; it allows results to\nbe compared between filters using a known corpus.\n\nFor SpamAssassin development, everyone has to maintain their own corpus.\n\n--j.\n",

Those are the ones that I\u0027m calling \"marginal\".\n\u003e Basically, I\u0027m hoping that \"the collective\" of Razor users make a better\n\u003e judge of spam than any single program like SA can, and therefore I can\n\u003e benefit from their judgement and get more extensive spam filtering. I\u0027ve\n\u003e seen examples of this already, where SA doesn\u0027t score the spam high enough\n\u003e to bounce it, but Razor does.\n\nI think perhaps you missed the fact that SA scores are adjustable.  If\nyou want SA to tag all messages listed in Razor then you can put this\nin your ~/.spamassassin/user_prefs file.\n\n  score RAZOR_CHECK 10\n\nThe default score is 3 and the default threshold needed is 5.\nTherefore if you wish to have any razor listed messages tagged by SA\nthen setting a score for any razor listed messages to anything above 5\nwould be sufficient.\n\nIf you are already using SA then the above would be more efficient.\nOtherwise you are running all of the mail through razor twice, once\nfor SA and once again afterward.  If you really want to run Razor\nindividually then you should set the \u0027score RAZOR_CHECK 0\u0027 so that SA\nwon\u0027t do it and avoid the double network hit.\n\nHowever, one of the benefits of using SA in combination with Razor has\nbeen the history of false positive reports in the razor database.  The\ncurrent score of 3 is hefty, but not enough by itself to tag as spam.\nBut for any real spam is usually enough to push it over the threshold.\nRazor2 addresses the false positive problem but is not yet in as wide\nof use as Razor1.\n\nBob\n\n--huq684BweRXVnRxX\nContent-Type: application/pgp-signature\nContent-Disposition: inline\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.0.7 (GNU/Linux)\n\niD8DBQE9iV7k0pRcO8E2ULYRAjoAAJ97CB6LpbhPHqa8IJx1l4g/LRiVdwCfUZIB\nkUAK30zsRWL8PTb1TrEQuy8\u003d\n\u003dXVm6\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n--huq684BweRXVnRxX--\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek\nWelcome to geek heaven.\nhttp://thinkgeek.com/sf\n_______________________________________________\nRazor-users mailing list\nRazor-users@lists.sourceforge.net\nhttps://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/razor-users\n\n",

Unfortunately, you hit a\n\u003e \u003ebunch of problems:\n\u003e \n\u003e \u003e    a.. When can you \"commit\" a state as being \"good\"?  You can\u0027t run from\n\u003e a\n\u003e \u003eredo log forever; the performance and storage penalties accumulate. Even\n\u003e log\n\u003e \u003estructured file systems garbage collect eventually. So you have to commit\n\u003e \u003esometime. The problem is that if you commit too eagerly, you might commit\n\u003e \u003ecorrupted state. If you commit too conservatively, you eat performance and\n\u003e \u003estorage penalties.\n\u003e \u003e    b.. What do you do if you discover that there is corrupted state in the\n\u003e \u003e*middle* of your redo log, and you want some of the critical state that\n\u003e \u003ecomes after it? You need some way to dig the corruption out of the middle\n\u003e \u003eand save the rest. My dissertation solves this problem, but you have to\n\u003e \u003ere-write everything in my programming language :)\n\u003e .    c.. Just doing this at all imposes substantial performance penalties. I\n\u003e \u003elove VMWare, and use it every day (the best $200 I ever spent on software)\n\u003e \u003e.but it is not very fast.\n\u003e \n\u003e My proposed solution to the first two problems you mention is to be less\n\u003e ambitious. The idea is that you *never* commit - instead, you simply revert\n\u003e to base state on reboot. Obviously, you can\u0027t do this with partitions that\n\u003e accrue important state, e.g. a partition that stores database table data.\n\u003e But in your typical web application, most partitions do not accrue important\n\u003e state. For example, your typical web server or application server could have\n\u003e their entire state reset back to a known base state during each reboot\n\u003e without harm.\n\u003e The advantage of being less ambitious is that we have a quick and easy way\n\u003e to frustrate certain attacks without rewriting all of our software or\n\u003e spending lots of money on additional application-specific coding.\n\u003e \n\u003e The first two problems you describe only occur if we become more ambitious\n\u003e and try to apply these same techniques to, for example, the database table\n\u003e partitions, where state changes remain important across reboots. That would\n\u003e certainly be a nice touch! But as you point out, many problems would have to\n\u003e be addressed first, and the hardest of these can not be abstracted away from\n\u003e the particular application. Not the least of these is the problem of writing\n\u003e heuristics for delineating good from malevolent state. That task is roughly\n\u003e analogous to what antiviral software authors do for a living, only this work\n\u003e could not be shared across many different systems as it would be specific to\n\u003e a paritcular application.\n\u003e \n\u003e The third problem you mention - performance penalty - is an argument for\n\u003e doing this in hardware, much like hardware raid. Another argument for doing\n\u003e this in hardware is hack resistance. Changing the base instance should\n\u003e require physical access to the console, e.g. by requiring that you first\n\u003e flip a physical switch on your RAID hardware or modify a bios setting. If\n\u003e the base image can be modified remotely or by software, then you have to\n\u003e worry about whether an implementation flaw might permit a cracker to modify\n\u003e the base image remotely.\n\u003e \n\u003e Ben\n\n-- \n    (                                                ______\n    ))   .-- Scott MacKenzie; Dine\u0027 College ISD --.   \u003e\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003c--.\n  C|~~| (\u003e---  Phone/Voice Mail:  928-724-6639 ---\u003c) | ; o |-\u0027\n   |  |  \\---  Senior DBA/CARS Coordinator/Etc. --/  |  _  |\n   `--\u0027   `- Email: scottm@crystal.ncc.cc.nm.us -\u0027   `-----\u0027\n\n",

You can\u0027t\n\u003e           run from a redo log forever; the performance and storage\n\u003e           penalties accumulate. Even log structured file systems\n\u003e           garbage collect eventually. So you have to commit sometime.\n\u003e           The problem is that if you commit too eagerly, you might\n\u003e           commit corrupted state. If you commit too conservatively,\n\u003e           you eat performance and storage penalties.\n\u003e         * What do you do if you discover that there is corrupted state\n\u003e           in the *middle* of your redo log, and you want some of the\n\u003e           critical state that comes after it? You need some way to dig\n\u003e           the corruption out of the middle and save the rest. My\n\u003e           dissertation solves this problem, but you have to re-write\n\u003e           everything in my programming language :)\n\u003e         * Just doing this at all imposes substantial performance\n\u003e           penalties.

This is why you would consolidate all state of any long-term\nsignificance on just a couple partitions, and why you would not put static\napplication code on these changeable partitions. Fortunately, most large\nclient/server application physical architectures do this anyhow, because\nthese are two fundamentally different kinds of state with two very different\nsets of administrative, security, RAID, and backup requirements. People also\ntend to do this anyhow because layered logical architectures are popular\nwith the GUI at one end, business logic in the middle, and persistence\nservices at the other. This logical architecture maps naturally to a\nphysical architecture that has a static web server, a static application\nserver, and a database server that has static and changeable partitions. (I\nuse the word static versus changeable instead of writeable versus unwritable\nbecause the \"unchangeable\" partitions might be written to for temporary swap\nspace. Who knows what Windows does internally?)\n\nMy point is that there should be a market out there for a hardware RAID\ndevice that can split designated partitions into a permanent base image\npartition and a temporary delta image partition, that has some simple but\nsolid security measures to prevent the unauthorized remote modification of\nbase images, and that can be configured to clear the delta image when the\nserver is rebooted. If some vendor wished to implement this, they could then\nmarket this as a mechanism to help frustrate broad classes of attack that\nrely on the permanent modification of system or application files via buffer\noverflows, platform and middleware bugs, etc. The prevention of unauthorized\nmodification of application data, of course, would not be addressed by this\nparticular product. But there are many other techniques out there to defend\napplication data. But those techniques all assume that your system itself\nhas not been compromised at a lower level, which is where this product could\nhelp.\n\nI would have to think that these features would be relatively easy for a\nhardware RAID vendor to implement. (I\u0027m just guessing, of course, with no\nknowledge of how hardware RAID works internally.) If anyone knows of such a\nproduct, I\u0027d love to hear about it.\n\nBen\n\n",

Argh... to complex and doesn\u0027t really solve the problem.\n\nWhere I can found good documentation about this topic?\n\nThere is another approach that I would share with the list, something I \nthought that can be of bit interest, but probabily wrong and insecure. \nAfter all, I\u0027m a real beginner in secure programming, and I\u0027m here to \nlearn methods and technics.\n\nFirst of all, I need a secure way to keep database passwords secure, so \nI have to keep them separate from the main server. The right approach \ncould be using a small java bean application that run as normal user \n(not tomcat, so it is not shared with other web services or, worst, the \nnobody user), that has no shell login, but has a default home directory \nor a place where it can hold passwords and keys.\n\nThe web application could then open an ssl connection (could be done in \nthe init method at server startup) to get database passwords. The small \nbean could check via code signature/rmi/whatever else that the source \nis the right one, and handle all the database connections, or give the \ndb connection/password to the main web application.\n\nIn this way, we solve the problem of keeping the keys and passwords in \nshared directories, and also, an attacker should get root/bean user \naccount to read data. This is not perfect, and works only if your \nprovider gives the opportunity to configure a separated java \napplication (that means, really, another server running in the \nbackground).\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nThank you,\nMario Torre\n-- \nPlease avoid sending me Word or PowerPoint attachments.\nSee http://www.fsf.org/philosophy/no-word-attachments.html \n",

Add the time to install and setup\nthe whole machinery, and I\u0027ll just keep hitting delete.\n\nThe suggestions so far have been to hook something on the delete\naction, that adds a message to the ham corpus.  I see two problems\nwith this: the ham will be a bit skewed; mail that I keep around\nwithout deleting will not be counted.  Secondly, if I by force of\nhabit happen to press the \u0027delete\u0027 key instead of the \u0027spam\u0027 key,\nI\u0027ll end up with spam in the ham, anyways.\n\nI would like to look for a way to deal with spam in the ham.\n\nThe obvious thing to do is to trigger on the \u0027spam\u0027 button,\nand at that time look for messages similar to the deleted one\nin the ham corpus, and simply remove them.  To do this we\nneed a way to compare two word count histograms, to see\nhow similar they are.  Any ideas ?\n\nAlso, I personally would prefer to not see the spam at all.\nIf they get bounced (preferably already in the SMTP),\nfalse positives become the senders problem, to rewrite\nto remove the spam smell.\n\nIn a well tuned system then, there spam corpus will be much\nsmaller than the ham corpus, so it would be possible to be\nslightly over-agressive when clearing potential spam from\nthe ham corpus.  This should make it easier to keep it clean.\n\nHaving a good way to remove spam from the ham corpus,\nthere\u0027s less need to worry about it getting there by mistake,\nand we might as well simply add all messages to the ham corpus,\nthat didn\u0027t get deleted by the spam filtering.\n\nIt might also be useful to have a way to remove messages from\nthe spam corpus, in case of user ooops.\n\n\t/Paul\n",

    "message": "\n[Jeremy Hylton]\n\u003e I think one step towards deployment is creating a re-usable tokenizer\n\u003e for mail messages.  The current codebase doesn\u0027t expose an easy-to-use\n\u003e or easy-to-customize tokenizer.\n\ntokenize() couldn\u0027t be easier to use:  it takes a string argument, and\nproduces a stream of tokens (whether via explicit list, or generator, or\ntuple, or ... doesn\u0027t matter).  All the tokenize() functions in GBayes.py\nand timtest.py are freely interchangeable this way.\n\nNote that we have no evidence to support that a customizable tokenizer would\ndo any good, or, if it would, in which ways customization could be helpful.\nThat\u0027s a research issue on which no work has been done.\n\n\u003e The timtest module seems to contain an enormous body of practical\n\u003e knowledge about how to parse mail messages, but the module wasn\u0027t\n\u003e designed for re-use.\n\nThat\u0027s partly a failure of imagination \u003cwink\u003e.  Splitting out all knowledge\nof tokenization is just a large block cut-and-paste ... there, it\u0027s done.\nChange the\n\n    from timtoken import tokenize\n\nat the top to use any other tokenizer now.  If you want to make it easier\nstill, feel free to check in something better.\n\n\u003e I\u0027d like to see a module that can take a single message or a collection of\n\u003e messages and tokenize each one.\n\nThe Msg and MsgStream classes in timtest.py are a start at that, but it\u0027s\nhard to do anything truly *useful* here when people use all sorts of\ndifferent physical representations for email msgs (mboxes in various\nformats, one file per \"folder\", one file per msg, Skip\u0027s gzipped gimmick,\n...).  If you\u0027re a Python coder \u003cwink\u003e, you *should* find it very easy to\nchange the guts of Msg and MsgStream to handle your peculiar scheme.\nDefining interfaces for these guys should be done.\n\n\u003e I\u0027d like to see the tokenize by customizable, too.  Tim had to exclude\n\u003e some headers from his test data, because there were particular biases\n\u003e in the test data.  If other people have test data without those\n\u003e biases, they ought to be able to customize the tokenizer to include\n\u003e them or exclude others.\n\nThis sounds like a bottomless pit to me, and there\u0027s no easier way to\ncustomize than to edit the code.  As README.txt still says, though, massive\nrefactoring would help.  Hop to it!\n",

As mentioned elsewhere, even\nL|Unix users may find an MUA solution easier to use then getting it added to\ntheir MTA. (SysOps make programmers look like flaming liberals ;).)\n\nMy notion of a solution for Windows/Outlook has been, as Guido described, a\nclient-server. Client side does pop3/imap/mapi fetching (of which, I\u0027m only\ngoing to implement pop3 initially) potentially on several hosts, spamhams\nthe incoming mail and puts it into one file per message (qmail style?). The\nMUA accesses this \"eThunk\" as a server to obtain all the ham. Spam is\nretained in the eThunk and a simple viewer would be used for manual\noversight on the spam for ultimate rejection (and training of spam filter)\nand the ham will go forward (after being used for training) on the next MUA\nfetch. eThunk would sit on a timer for \u0027always online\u0027 users, but I am not\nclear on how to support dialup users with this scheme.\n\nOutbound mail would use a direct path from the MUA to the MTA. Hopefully all\nMUAs can split the host fetch/send URL\u0027s\n\nIMO, end users are likely to be more intested in n-way classification. If\nthis is available, the \"simple viewer\" could be enhanced to support viewing\nvia folders and (at least for me) the Outlook nightmare is over - I would\nuse this as my only MUA. (N.B. according to my recent readings, the best\nn-way classifier uses something called a \"Support Vector Machine\" (SVM)\nwhich is 5-8% more accurate then Naive Bayes (NB) ).\n\nI wonder if the focus of spambayes ought not to be a classifier that leaves\nthe fetching and feeding of messages to auxillary code? That way, it could\nbe dropped into whatever harness that suited the user\u0027s situation.\n\nDavid LeBlanc\nSeattle, WA USA\n\n",

I had to scrub a\n  \u003e\u003e bunch of previously unnoticed spam from my inbox.)  Both\n  \u003e\u003e collections have about 1100 messages.\n\n  TP\u003e Does this mean you trained on about 1100 of each?\n\nThe total collections are 1100 messages.  I trained with 1100/5\nmessages. \n\n  TP\u003e Can\u0027t guess.  You\u0027re in a good position to start adding more\n  TP\u003e headers into the analysis, though.  For example, an easy start\n  TP\u003e would be to uncomment the header-counting lines in tokenize()\n  TP\u003e (look for \"Anthony\").  Likely the most valuable thing it\u0027s\n  TP\u003e missing then is some special parsing and tagging of Received\n  TP\u003e headers.\n\nI tried the \"Anthony\" stuff, but it didn\u0027t make any appreciable\ndifference that I could see from staring at the false negative rate.\nThe numbers are big enough that a quick eyeball suffices.\n\nThen I tried a dirt simple tokenizer for the headers that tokenize the\nwords in the header and emitted like this \"%s: %s\" % (hdr, word).\nThat worked too well :-).  The received and date headers helped the\nclassifier discover that most of my spam is old and most of my ham is\nnew.\n\nSo I tried a slightly more complex one that skipped received, data,\nand x-from_, which all contained timestamps.  I also skipped the X-VM-\nheaders that my mail reader added:\n\nclass MyTokenizer(Tokenizer):\n\n    skip \u003d {\u0027received\u0027: 1,\n            \u0027date\u0027: 1,\n            \u0027x-from_\u0027: 1,\n            }\n\n    def tokenize_headers(self, msg):\n        for k, v in msg.items():\n            k \u003d k.lower()\n            if k in self.skip or k.startswith(\u0027x-vm\u0027):\n                continue\n            for w in subject_word_re.findall(v):\n                for t in tokenize_word(w):\n                    yield \"%s:%s\" % (k, t)\n\nThis did moderately better.  The false negative rate is 7-21% over the\ntests performed so far.  This is versus 11-28% for the previous test\nrun that used the timtest header tokenizer.\n\nIt\u0027s interesting to see that the best descriminators are all ham\ndiscriminators.  There\u0027s not a single spam-indicator in the list.\nMost of the discriminators are header fields.  One thing to note is\nthat the presence of Mailman-generated headers is a strong non-spam\nindicator.  That matches my intuition: I got an awful lot of\nMailman-generated mail, and those lists are pretty good at surpressing\nspam.  The other thing is that I get a lot of ham from people who use\nXEmacs.  That\u0027s probably Barry, Guido, Fred, and me :-).\n\nOne final note.  It looks like many of the false positives are from\npeople I\u0027ve never met with questions about Shakespeare.  They often\nstart with stuff like:\n\n\u003e Dear Sir/Madam,\n\u003e \n\u003e May I please take some of your precious time to ask you to help me to find a\n\u003e solution to a problem that is worrying me greatly.

What you seemed to\nshow is that you did *something* clever with headers and that doing so\nhelped (the \"after\" numbers are better than the \"before\" numbers, right?).\nAssuming that what you did was override what\u0027s now\ntokenizer.Tokenizer.tokenize_headers with some other routine, and didn\u0027t\ncall the base Tokenizer.tokenize_headers at all, then you\u0027re missing\ncarefully tested treatment of just a few header fields, but adding many\ndozens of other header fields.  There\u0027s no question that adding more header\nfields should help; tokenizer.Tokenizer.tokenize_headers doesn\u0027t do so only\nbecause my testing corpora are such that I can\u0027t add more headers without\ngetting major benefits for bogus reasons.\n\nApart from all that, you said you\u0027re skipping Received.  By several\naccounts, that may be the most valuable of all the header fields.  I\u0027m\n(meaning tokenizer.Tokenizer.tokenize_headers) skipping them too for the\nreason explained above.  Offline a week or two ago, Neil Schemenauer\nreported good results from this scheme:\n\n    ip_re \u003d re.compile(r\u0027(\\d{1,3}\\.\\d{1,3}\\.\\d{1,3}\\.\\d{1,3})\u0027)\n\n    for header in msg.get_all(\"received\", ()):\n        for ip in ip_re.findall(header):\n            parts \u003d ip.split(\".\")\n            for n in range(1, 5):\n                yield \u0027received:\u0027 + \u0027.\u0027.join(parts[:n])\n\nThis makes a lot of sense to me; I just checked it in, but left it disabled\nfor now.\n",

Most hotels are less than responsive...\n\n\tRadission - Barcelo Hotel (DuPont Circle)\n\t$125/night, $99/weekend\n\n\tState Plaza hotel (Foggy Bottom; near GWU)\n\t$119/night, $99/weekend\n\n\tHilton Silver Spring (Near Metro, in suburban MD)\n\t$99/hight, $74/weekend\n\n\tWindsor Park Hotel\n\tConn Ave, between DuPont Circle/Woodley Park Metro stations\n\t$95/night; needs a car\n\n\tEcono Lodge Alexandria (Near Metro, in suburban VA)\n\t$95/night\n\nThis is a hand picked list; I ignored anything over $125/night, even\nthough there are some really well situated hotels nearby at higher rates.\nAlso, I\u0027m not sure how much these prices reflect an expedia-only\ndiscount.  I can\u0027t vouch for any of these hotels, either.\n\nI also found out that the down season for DC Hotels are mid-june through\nmid-september, and mid-november through mid-january.\n\nZ.\n\"\"\"\n\nThis one has no MIME structure nor HTML!  It even has a\nContent-disposition which is counted as a non-spam clue.  It got\nf-p\u0027ed because of the many hospitality-related and money-related\nterms.  I\u0027m surprised $125/night and similar aren\u0027t clues too.  (And\nagain, several spam clues are duplicated with different variations:\n\u0027hotel\u0027, \u0027hotels\u0027, \u0027hotels.\u0027, \u0027subject:Hotel\u0027, \u0027rates,\u0027, \u0027rates.\u0027.\n\n\u003e WRT hating HTML, possibilities include:\n\u003e \n\u003e 1. It really had to do with something other than MIME/HTML.\n\u003e \n\u003e 2. These are pure HTML (not multipart/alternative with a text/plain part),\n\u003e    so that the tags aren\u0027t getting stripped.  The pickled classifier\n\u003e    despises all hints of HTML due to its c.l.py heritage.\n\u003e \n\u003e 3. These are multipart/alternative with a text/plain part, but the\n\u003e    latter doesn\u0027t contain the same text as the text/html part (for\n\u003e    example, as Anthony reported, perhaps the text/plain part just\n\u003e    says something like \"This is an HMTL message.\").\n\u003e \n\u003e If it\u0027s #2, it would be easy to add an optional bool argument to tokenize()\n\u003e meaning \"even if it is pure HTML, strip the tags anyway\".  In fact, I\u0027d like\n\u003e to do that and default it to True.  The extreme hatred of HTML on tech lists\n\u003e strikes me as, umm, extreme \u003cwink\u003e.\n\nI also looked in more detail at some f-p\u0027s in my geeks traffic.  The\nfirst one\u0027s a doozie (that\u0027s the term, right? :-).  It has lots of\nHTML clues that are apparently ignored.

I thought it was looking for\n\u003e clues with values in between; apparently it found none that weren\u0027t\n\u003e exactly 0.5?\n\nThere\u0027s a brief discussion of this before the definition of\nMAX_DISCRIMINATORS.  All clues with prob MIN_SPAMPROB and MAX_SPAMPROB are\nsaved in min and max lists, and all other clues are fed into the nbest heap.\nThen the shorter of the min and max lists cancels out the same number of\nclues in the longer list.  Whatever remains of the longer list (if anything)\nis then fed into the nbest heap too, but no more than MAX_DISCRIMINATORS of\nthem.  In no case do more than MAX_DISCRIMINATORS clues enter into the final\nprobability calculation, but all of the min and max lists go into the list\nof clues (else you\u0027d have no clue that massive cancellation was occurring;\nand massive cancellation may yet turn out to be a hook to signal that manual\nreview is needed).  In your specific case, the excess of clues in the longer\nMAX_SPAMPROB list pushed everything else out of the nbest heap, and that\u0027s\nwhy you didn\u0027t see anything other than 0.01 and 0.99.\n\nBefore adding these special lists, the outcome when faced with many 0.01 and\n0.99 clues was too often a coin toss:  whichever flavor just happened to\nappear MAX_DISCRIMINATORS//2 + 1 times first determined the final outcome.\n\n\u003e\u003e That sure sets the record for longest list of cancelling extreme clues!\n\n\u003e This happened to be the longest one, but there were quite a few\n\u003e similar ones.\n\nI just beat it \u003cwink\u003e:  a tokenization scheme that folds case, and ignores\npunctuation, and strips a trailing \u0027s\u0027 from words, and saves both word\nbigrams and word unigrams, turned up a low-probability very long spam with a\nlist of 410 0.01 clues and 125 0.99 clues!  Yikes.\n\n\u003e I wonder if there\u0027s anything we can learn from looking at the clues and\nthe\n\u003e HTML.  It was heavily marked-up HTML, with ads in the sidebar, but the\nbody\n\u003e text was a serious discussion of \"OO and soft coding\" with lots of highly\n\u003e technical words as clues (including Zope and ZEO).\n\nNo matter how often it says Zope, it gets only one 0.01 clue from doing so.\nDitto for ZEO.  In contrast, HTML markup has many unique \"words\" that get\n0.99.  BTW, this is a clear case where the assumption of\nconditionally-independent word probabilities is utterly bogus -- e.g., the\nprobability that \"\u003cbody\u003e\" appears in a message is highly correlated with the\nprob of \"\u003cbr\u003e\" appearing.  By treating them as independent, naive Bayes\ngrossly misjudges the probability that both appear, and the only thing you\nget in return is something that can actually be computed \u003cwink\u003e.\n\nRead the \"What about HTML?\" section in tokenizer.py.  From the very start,\nI\u0027ve been investigating what would work best for the mailing lists hosted at\npython.org, and HTML decorations have so far been too strong a clue to\njustify ignoring it in that specific context.  I haven\u0027t done anything\ngeared toward personal email, including the case of non-mailing-list email\nthat happens to go through python.org.\n\nI\u0027d prefer to strip HTML tags from everything, but last time I tried that it\nstill had bad effects on the error rates in my corpora (the full test\nresults with and without HTML tag stripping is included in the \"What about\nHTML?\" comment block).  But as the comment block also says,\n\n# XXX So, if another way is found to slash the f-n rate, the decision here\n# XXX not to strip HTML from HTML-only msgs should be revisited.\n\nand we\u0027ve since done several things that gave significant f-n rate\nreductions.  I should test that again now.\n\n\u003e Are there any minable-but-unmined header lines in your corpus left?\n\nAlmost all of them -- apart from MIME decorations that appear in both\nheaders and bodies (like Content-Type), the *only* header lines the base\ntokenizer looks at now are Subject, From, X-Mailer, and Organization.\n\n\u003e Or do we have to start with a different corpus before we can make\n\u003e progress there?\n\nI would need different data, yes.  My ham is too polluted with Mailman\nheader decorations (which I may or may not be able to clean out, but fudging\nthe data is a Mortal Sin and I haven\u0027t changed a byte so far), and my spam\ntoo polluted with header clues about the fellow who collected it.  In\nparticular I have to skip To and Received headers now, and I suspect they\u0027re\ngoing to be very valuable in real life (for example, I don\u0027t even catch\n\"undisclosed recipients\" in the To header now!).\n\n\u003e ...\n\u003e No, sorry.  These were all of the following structure:\n\u003e\n\u003e   multipart/mixed\n\u003e       text/plain        (brief text plus URL(s))\n\u003e       text/html         (long HTML copied from website)\n\nAh!  That explains why the HTML tags didn\u0027t get stripped.  I\u0027d again offer\nto add an optional argument to tokenize() so that they\u0027d get stripped here\ntoo, but if it gets glossed over a third time that would feel too much like\na loss \u003cwink\u003e.\n\n\u003e\u003e This seems confused: Jeremy didn\u0027t use my trained classifier pickle,\n\u003e\u003e he trained his own classifier from scratch on his own corpora.\n\u003e\u003e ...\n\n\u003e I think it\u0027s still corpus size.\n\nI reported on tests I ran with random samples of 220 spams and 220 hams from\nmy corpus (that means training on sets of those sizes as well as predicting\non sets of those sizes), and while that did harm the error rates, the error\nrates I saw were still much better than Jeremy reported when using 500 of\neach.\n\n\nAh, a full test run just finished, on the\n\n   tokenization scheme that folds case, and ignores punctuation, and strips\na\n   trailing \u0027s\u0027 from words, and saves both word bigrams and word unigrams\n\nThis is the code:\n\n            # Tokenize everything in the body.\n            lastw \u003d \u0027\u0027\n            for w in word_re.findall(text):\n                n \u003d len(w)\n                # Make sure this range matches in tokenize_word().\n                if 3 \u003c\u003d n \u003c\u003d 12:\n                    if w[-1] \u003d\u003d \u0027s\u0027:\n                        w \u003d w[:-1]\n                    yield w\n                    if lastw:\n                        yield lastw + w\n                    lastw \u003d w + \u0027 \u0027\n\n                elif n \u003e\u003d 3:\n                    lastw \u003d \u0027\u0027\n                    for t in tokenize_word(w):\n                        yield t\n\nwhere\n\n    word_re \u003d re.compile(r\"[\\w$\\-\\x80-\\xff]+\")\n\nThis at least doubled the process size over what\u0027s done now.

    "message": "\n[followups to spambayes@python.org please, unless you\u0027re specifically\n concerned about some particular bit of email policy for python.org]\n\nOK, after much fiddling with and tweaking of /etc/exim/exim4.conf and\n/etc/exim/local_scan.py on mail.python.org, I am fairly confident that\nI can start harvesting all incoming email at a moment\u0027s notice.  For the\nrecord, here\u0027s how it all works:\n\n  * exim4.conf works almost exactly the same as before if the file\n    /etc/exim/harvest does not exist.  That is, any \"junk mail\n    condition\" that can be detected by Exim ACLs (access control lists)\n    is handled entirely in exim4.conf: the message is rejected before it\n    ever gets to local_scan.py.  This covers such diverse cases as\n    \"message from known spammer\" (reject after every RCPT TO command),\n    \"no message-id header\", and \"8-bit chars in subject\" (both rejected\n    after the message headers/body are read).\n\n    The main things I have changed in the absence of /etc/exim/harvest\n    are:\n      - don\u0027t check for 8-bit chars in \"From\" header -- the vast\n        majority of hits for this test were bounces from some\n        Asian ISP; the remaining hits should be handled by SpamAssassin\n      - do header sender verification (ie. ensure that there\u0027s a\n        verifiable email address in at least one of \"From\", \"Reply-to\",\n        and \"Sender\") as late as possible, because it requires DNS\n        lookups which can be slow (and can also make messages that\n        should have been rejected merely be deferred, if those DNS\n        lookups timeout)\n\n  * if /etc/exim/harvest exists, then the behaviour of all of those\n    ACLs in exim4.conf suddenly changes: instead of rejecting recipients\n    or messages, they add an X-reject header to the message.  This\n    header is purely for internal use; it records the name of the folder\n    to which the rejected message should be saved, and also gives the\n    SMTP error message which should ultimately be used to reject\n    the message.\n\n    Thus, those messages will now be seen by local_scan.py, which now\n    looks for the X-reject header.  If found, it uses the folder name\n    specified there to save the message, and then rejects it with the\n    SMTP error message also given in X-reject.  (Currently X-reject is\n    retained in saved messages.)\n\n    If a message was not tagged with X-reject, then local_scan.py\n    runs the usual virus and spam checks.  (Namely, my homebrew\n    scan for attachments with filenames that look like Windows\n    executables, and a run through SpamAssassin.)  The logic is\n    basically this:\n      if virus:\n          folder \u003d \"virus\"\n      else:\n          run through SpamAssassin\n          if score \u003e\u003d 10.0:\n              folder \u003d \"rejected-spam\"\n          elif score \u003e\u003d 5.0:\n              folder \u003d \"caught-spam\"\n\n    Finally, local_scan.py writes the message to the designated folder.\n    By far the biggest folder will be \"accepted\" -- the server handles\n    2000-5000 incoming messages per day, of which maybe 100-500 are junk\n    mail.  (Oops, just realized I haven\u0027t written the code that actually\n    saves the message -- d\u0027ohh!  Also haven\u0027t written anything to\n    discriminate personal email, which I must do.  Sigh.)\n\n  * finally, the big catch: waiting until after you\u0027ve read the message\n    headers and body to actually reject the message is problematic,\n    because certain broken MTAs (including those used by some spammers)\n    don\u0027t consider a 5xx after DATA as a permanent error, but keep\n    retrying.  D\u0027ohh.  This is a minor annoyance currently, where a fair\n    amount of stuff is rejected at RCPT TO time.  But in harvest mode,\n    *everything* (with the exception of people probing for open relays)\n    will be rejected at DATA time.  So I have cooked up something called\n    the ASBL, or automated sender blacklist.  This is just a Berkeley DB\n    file that maps (sender_ip, sender_address) to an expiry time.  When\n    local_scan() rejects a message from (sender_ip, sender_address) --\n    for whatever reason, including finding an X-reject header added by\n    an ACL in exim4.conf -- it adds a record to the ASBL, with an expiry\n    time 3 hours in the future.  Meanwhile, there\u0027s an ACL in exim4.conf\n    that checks for records in the ASBL; if there\u0027s a record for the\n    current (sender_ip, sender_address) that hasn\u0027t expired yet, we\n    reject all recipients without ever looking at the message headers or\n    body.\n\n    The downside of this from the point-of-view of corpus collection is\n    that if some jerk is busily spamming *@python.org, one SMTP\n    connection per address, we will most likely only get one copy.  This\n    is a win if you\u0027re just thinking about reducing server load and\n    bandwidth, but I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s helpful for training spam\n    detectors.

I\u0027ve informally\nreported some results from just a few controlled experiments on that.\nJeremy reported improved accuracy by doubling the training set size, but\nthat wasn\u0027t a controlled experiment (things besides just training set size\nchanged between \"before\" and \"after\").\n\n\u003e Ham distribution for all runs:\n\u003e * \u003d 589 items\n\u003e   0.00 35292 ************************************************************\n\u003e   2.50    36 *\n\u003e   5.00    21 *\n\u003e   7.50    12 *\n\u003e  10.00     6 *\n\u003e ...\n\u003e  90.00     4 *\n\u003e  92.50     8 *\n\u003e  95.00    15 *\n\u003e  97.50   441 *\n\u003e\n\u003e Spam distribution for all runs:\n\u003e * \u003d 504 items\n\u003e   0.00   393 *\n\u003e   2.50    17 *\n\u003e   5.00    18 *\n\u003e   7.50    12 *\n\u003e  10.00     4 *\n\u003e ...\n\u003e  90.00    11 *\n\u003e  92.50    16 *\n\u003e  95.00    45 *\n\u003e  97.50 30226 ************************************************************\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e My next (current) task is to complete the corpus I\u0027ve got - it\u0027s currently\n\u003e got ~ 9000 ham, 7800 spam, and about 9200 currently unsorted. I\u0027m tossing\n\u003e up using either hammie or spamassassin to do the initial sort  -\npreviously\n\u003e I\u0027ve used various forms of \u0027grep\u0027 for keywords and a little gui thing to\n\u003e pop a message up and let me say \u0027spam/ham\u0027, but that\u0027s just getting too,\ntoo\n\u003e tedious.\n\nYup, tagging data is mondo tedious, and mistakes hurt.\n\nI expect hammie will do a much better job on this already than hand\ngrepping.  Be sure to stare at the false positives and get the spam out of\nthere.\n\n\u003e I can\u0027t make it available en masse, but I will look at finding some of\n\u003e the more \u0027interesting\u0027 uglies. One thing I\u0027ve seen (consider this\n\u003e \u0027anecdotal\u0027 for now) is that the \u0027skip\u0027 tokens end up in a _lot_ of the\n\u003e f-ps.\n\nWith probabilities favoring ham or spam?  A skip token is produced in lieu\nof \"word\" more than 12 chars long and without any high-bit characters.  It\u0027s\npossible that they helped me because raw HTML produces lots of these.\nHowever, if you\u0027re running current CVS, Tokenizer/retain_pure_html_tags\ndefaults to False now, so HTML decorations should vanish before body\ntokenization.\n",

If you did partition them randomly, the wild\nvariance across runs is mondo mysterious.\n\n\n\u003e\u003e I expect hammie will do a much better job on this already than hand\n\u003e\u003e grepping.

I added code to strip uuencoded sections, and pump out uuencode\nsummary tokens instead.  I\u0027ll check it in.

Mom now knew to go straight to \nher husband\u0027s cigarettes, and she read from the Benson \u0026 Hedges pack: \n\"Extra Long, King Size\".  She was again slightly embarrassed but still \nhappy for her daughter. \n\nThe third girl left for her honeymoon in the Caribbean.  Mom waited for \na week, nothing.

Mom took out her latest \nHarper\u0027s Bazaar magazine, flipped through the pages fearing the worst, \nand finally found the ad for the airline.

    "message": "\n\nForwarded-by: Flower\n\nDid you know that you can tell from the skin whether a user is\nsexually active or not?\n\n1. Sex is a beauty treatment. Scientific tests find that when woman\n   make love they produce more of the hormone estrogen, which makes\n   hair shiny and skin smooth.\n\n2. Gentle, relaxed lovemaking reduces your chances of suffering\n   dermatitis, skin rashes and blemishes. The sweat produced cleanses\n   the pores and makes your skin glow.\n\n3. Lovemaking can burn up those calories you piled on during that\n   romantic dinner.\n\n4. Sex is one of the safest sports you can take up. It stretches\n   and tones up just about every muscle in the body. It\u0027s more enjoyable\n   than swimming 20 laps, and you don\u0027t need special sneakers!\n\n5. Sex is an instant cure for mild depression. It releases the body\n   endorphin into the bloodstream, producing a sense of euphoria and\n   leaving you with a feeling of well-being.\n\n6. The more sex you have, the more you will be offered. The sexually\n   active body gives off greater quantities of chemicals called\n   pheromones.  These subtle sex perfumes drive the opposite sex crazy!\n\n7. Sex is the safest tranquilizer in the world. IT IS 10 TIMES MORE\n   EFFECTIVE THAN VALIUM.\n\n8. Kissing each day will keep the dentist away. Kissing encourages\n   saliva to wash food from the teeth and lowers the level of the acid\n   that causes decay, preventing plaque build-up.\n\n9. Sex actually relieves headaches. A lovemaking session can release\n   the tension that restricts blood vessels in the brain.\n\n10. A lot of lovemaking can unblock a stuffy nose. Sex is a national\n    antihistamine. It can help combat asthma and hay fever.\n\nENJOY SEX!\n\n",

    "message": "\n\nForwarded-by: Chris Wedgwood \u003ccw@f00f.org\u003e\nFrom: Bert\n\n01. I was so poor growing up...  if I wasn\u0027t a boy...  I\u0027d have had\n    nothing to play with.\n\n02. A girl phoned me the other day and said, \"Come on over; nobody\u0027s\n    home.\"  I went over. Nobody was home.\n\n03. During sex, my girlfriend always wants to talk to me.  Just the\n    other night she called me from a hotel\n\n04. One day I came home early from work...  I saw a guy jogging\n    naked. I said to the guy, \"Hey buddy, why are you doing that?\"  He\n    said \"Because you came home early.\"\n\n05. It\u0027s been a rough day. I got up this morning...  put a shirt on\n    and button fell off.  I picked up my briefcase, and the handle\n    came off.  I\u0027m afraid to go to the bathroom.\n\n06. I was such an ugly kid...  When I played in the sandbox, the cat\n    kept covering me up.\n\n07. I could tell my parents hated me.  My bath toys were a toaster and\n    radio.\n\n08. I was such an ugly baby...  My mother never breast fed me. She\n    told me that she only liked me as a friend.\n\n09. I\u0027m so ugly...  My father carries around a picture of the kid who\n    came with his wallet.\n\n10. When I was born, the doctor came into the waiting room and said to\n    my father, \"I\u0027m sorry. We did everything we could, but he pulled\n    through.\"\n\n11. I\u0027m so ugly...  My mother had morning sickness...  AFTER I was\n    born.\n\n12. I remember the time that I was kidnapped and they sent a piece of\n    my finger to my father.  He said he wanted more proof.\n\n13. Once when I was lost, I saw a policeman, and asked him to help me\n    find my parents. I said to him, \"Do you think we\u0027ll ever find\n    them?\" He said,\"I don\u0027t know kid. There\u0027s so many places they can\n    hide.\"\n\n14. My wife made me join a bridge club. I jump off next Tuesday.\n\n15. I\u0027m so ugly...  I worked in a pet shop, and people kept asking how\n    big I\u0027d get.\n\n16. I went to see my doctor. \"Doctor, every morning when I get up and\n    I look in the mirror...  I feel like throwing up; What\u0027s wrong\n    with me?\" He said...  \"I don\u0027t know but your eyesight is perfect.\"\n\n17. I went to the doctor because I\u0027d swallowed a bottle of sleeping\n    pills. My doctor told me to have a few drinks and get some rest.\n\n18. With my old man I got no respect. I asked him, \"How can I get my\n    kite in the air?\" He told me to run off a cliff.\n\n19. Some dog I got. We call him Egypt because in every room he leaves\n    a pyramid. His favorite bone is in my arm.  Last night he went on\n    the paper four times - three of those times I was reading it.\n\n20. One year they wanted to make me poster boy - for birth control.\n\n21. My uncle\u0027s dying wish was to have me sitting in his lap; he was in\n    the electric chair.\n\n",

    "message": "\nURL: http://boingboing.net/#85482094\nDate: Not supplied\n\nJanis Ian, a brave and talented recording artist (and budding and talented \nscience fiction writer) has done a terrific interview with the Slashdot \ngroupmind about her views on the music industry. \n\n    Seriously, diversity is something record companies can\u0027t afford anymore - \n    not the majors, at any rate. I\u0027d go to this article, posted at Linux \n    Journal, which quotes a Newsweet article (July 15,2002) by Steven Levy \n    saying \"So why are the record labels taking such a hard line? My guess is \n    that it\u0027s all about protecting their Internet-challenged business model. \n    Their profit comes from blockbuster artists. If the industry moved to a \n    more varied ecology, independent labels and artists would thrive--to the \n    detriment of the labels, which would have trouble rustling up the rubes to \n    root for the next Britney. The smoking gun comes from testimony of an \n    RIAA-backed economist who told the government fee panel that a dramatic \n    shakeout in Webcasting is \"inevitable and desirable because it will bring \n    about market consolidation.\" That\u0027s really it in a nutshell. \"Market \n    consolidation\" means the less artists they have to promote, the less \n    ultimate dollars they\u0027ll spend. The smaller the playlist, the greater the \n    chance that audiences will buy something from that playlist alone - because \n    that\u0027s all you\u0027ll be able to find out there.  \n\nLink[1] Discuss[2]\n\n[1] http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid\u003d02/09/23/133228\n[2] http://www.quicktopic.com/boing/H/8nEQCxZaP8U6X\n\n",

Get it? \nToday\u0027s newzzz... Never mind. \n- Comments on Ben Hammersley\u0027s Friend of a Friend[7]. Various ways to link to a \nFOAF file from an RSS feed. \n- _Nicholas Chase_: The Web\u0027s future: XHTML 2.0[8]. We\u0027re losing backward \ncompatibility, isn\u0027t that great? Well, he seems to think so. \n- mod_cc[9], a module for including copyright information in RDF documents such \nas RSS 1.0 feeds, and, I hope, FOAF files. \n- _Shelley Powers_: Who is your audience, and what are you trying to \naccomplish?[10] Addressing the growing identity crisis on the RSS-DEV mailing \nlist[11]. Also the comments on Shelley\u0027s article[12]. \n- _Ian Hickson_: Pingback 1.0[13]. \u0026#8220;The best thing about this idea is \nthat unlike similar schemes like TrackBack, it is totally transparent to both \nusers.\u0026#8221; \n- New software helps in building of accessible web sites[14]. A press release \nfor a new edition of LIFT[15], which I have never used. \n- Forget Mars bars, Twinkies now the deep-fried treat[16]. \u0026#8220;The secret to \nmaking a deep-fried Twinkie, he says, is to place it in the fridge first to \ngive it more stability.

My sinus infection, which appeared to be gone, flared up again over \nthe weekend in the nastiest way, and I am now coughing up dark mucus and doing \nother things that probably don\u0027t bear repeating in a public forum. I have the \n10:15 doctor\u0027s appointment that I should have made last round, had I not \nconvinced myself that \u0026#8220;it\u0027s not that bad\u0026#8221; and trudged through it \nall without prescription drugs. I\u0027m not making the same mistake this time. I\u0027ll \nbe back this afternoon. \n\nMy email problems of yesterday have been resolved. You can once again reach me \nat my normal address, f8dy@diveintomark.org. \n\nKevin Burton[1] emailed me with another way to link to a FOAF file from my RSS \nfeed. It looks easier than previous suggestions, and it has the advantage of \nbeing able to use it from an RSS 1.0 or 2.0 feed, but I worry about all these \nvariations. Just as in real life, where people can use different words that \nmean essentially the same thing, in the Semantic Web programs can use different \nvocabularies to express the same statements. That\u0027s great for producers, not so \ngreat for consumers who have to make sense of it all. \n\nFor each domain (RSS feeds, FOAF files, whatever), somebody (or some group) \nneeds to come along and document best practices. We need better _goal-oriented_ \ndocumentation. We have a lot of reference documentation, task-oriented \ndocumentation, but very little that documents that larger picture and answers \nquestions written in English. \u0026#8220;How do I include personal information in \nmy RSS feed?\u0026#8221; is a goal-oriented question. \u0026#8220;Create a FOAF file \nusing this tool and then insert this line at this location in your RSS \nfeed\u0026#8221; (with as many examples as necessary) is a goal-oriented answer. \nAnything less is like trying to master a foreign language by reading a \ndictionary.\n\n\n\n[1] http://www.peerfear.org/\n\n",

Counterpoint: the default \nin most weblog systems is to only publish excerpts in RSS feeds; nobody\u0027s \nforcing you to publish full posts.

Napster, at heart just IRC with a UI, \nwas one. Google News[1] is another. \n\nIn its first day, I\u0027ve already noticed: \n\n- The front page changes its editorial stance depending on where the earth\u0027s \nterminator[2] is. So in the evening on the West Coast, Google News is lead by \nthe South China Morning Post, and various Asian english-language papers. By the \nlate evening, the BBC and European papers are kicking in. \n- The site may be created by algorithms - but what about the choice of sites? \nThe most arbitrary dividing line I see in Google\u0027s coverage is what is a news \nsite, and what isn\u0027t. Slashdot[3] is, for instance, as well as some very \nobscure[4] newspapers. What about Blues News[5] or Scripting News[6], though? \n- Big companies spend mucho money paying \"clipping services\" that send them \ncopies of any press coverage they receive. Clipping services are going to have \nto find some added value, very[7] very[8] quickly. \n\n[1] http://news.google.com/\n[2] http://www.concentric.net/~marsface/glossary.htm#sectT\n    The\nsunrise-sunset line dividing the day and night halves of the Moon or a\nplanet.\n[3] http://www.slashdot.org/\n[4] http://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/\n[5] http://www.bluesnews.com/\n[6] http://www.scripting.com/\n[7] http://news.google.com/news?hl\u003den\u0026q\u003d%22Danny+O%27Brien%22\u0026btnG\u003dGoogle+Search\n[8] http://news.google.com/news?hl\u003den\u0026q\u003dwww.ntk.net\u0026btnG\u003dGoogle+Search\n\n",

RDF adds another layer of \ntedium, but there are still a few folks willing to write it by hand. I make \nheavy use of reification/quoting in my representation of logical formulas in \nRDF.

This will go someplace interesting.  \n\nI left a big hint there in the way the blogChannel module[3] is designed, \npatterned after the Syndication module[4] designed by the RDF folk. In other \nwords, the place where they\u0027re expressing discomfort with RSS 2.0 is where they \ncan make it their own. Lead. Instead of feeling disempowered, be powerful.  \n\nAt one point I saw clearly where the compromise between RSS 0.9x and 1.0 was. \nWe could have gotten there in early 2001, so instead we get there in late 2002. \nSo what, not a big deal. Think about how much better it will be _when we\u0027re all \nadvocating the same format._ Visualize peace. That\u0027s basically what I did when \nI did the 2.0 spec.

That was pretty good. My heart \nwas racing like it hadn\u0027t since I was in college. They also did an extensive \nultrasound on my carotid arteries[1], they\u0027re in the neck and supply my head \nwith blood. More good news there. They\u0027re clear, free of plaque, healthy, not \ndiseased[2]. So it appears I just have coronary artery disease, not general \nartery disease. That\u0027s good because there would be a risk of stroke if they \nwere sick, and not a whole lot they can do about it (as they can with the \nheart). \n\nNow there was some not-good news. A small part of my heart isn\u0027t working very \nwell. There are a few possible reasons for that, some fixable, some not. I \nasked the doctor, does this mean I\u0027m going to die sooner, and he said no. Does \nit mean I have to restrict what I do, he said no. So what does it mean? Really \nnot much, other than I should watch, as before, for recurring symptoms, the \nones that brought me into the hospital in June. If they come back, we\u0027ll do an \nangiogram, and maybe an angioplasty, but the likelihood of another bypass \nbecause of this is small. That\u0027s quite a relief.

    "message": "\nURL: http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/#85471617\nDate: Not supplied\n\nA lot of people seem to be missing the point of Phoenix, as evidenced by the \nresponses on Mozilla News[1] and MozillaZine[2]. Let me emphasize something \nhere: if you think Mozilla\u0027s current UI is acceptable, then you are clearly not \nthe target audience for Phoenix.\n\nHere is a quiz to test whether or not Phoenix is the right browser for you.\n\n\n- The link toolbar is: \n\n\n- critical to my day-to-day use \n- vital when using Bugzilla! Doesn\u0027t everybody use Bugzilla?\n-  link what?\n\n\n\n- The sidebar is \n\n\n- indispensable since i run at 1600x1200 resolution \n- not cool enough, since i can\u0027t float and dock all my panels and have \nsplitters between all panels and see web page progress for individual HTML \npanels and check my email entirely from within sidebar and... \n- a waste of real estate\n\n\n\n- Form auto-fill \n\n\n- is not useful for me unless I can fill out 20 pages of personal information \nfirst \n- should just happen automatically\n\n\n\n- Downloads \n\n\n- should take place in a tree view with progress meters in the columns! \n- should be clearly visible and understandable.\n\n\n\n- Toolbars should \n\n\n- be dockable to all four corners of the screen, be able to float outside the \nwindow, be fully customizable such that I can make my own custom commands, be \nable to edit existing buttons\u0027 commands, be able to create my own toolbars, be \nable to put toolbars on the same line, and be able to edit the submenus and \ncontext menus of items (including the items on the menu bar) and browse my file \nsystem and cook me dinner and wash my car and walk my dog and do my taxes and \nmow my lawn and... \n- be customizable within reason\n\n\n\n- Composer should \n\n\n- always come with my browser. I want composer options all over my UI. \nEverywhere! \n- not be part of a Web browser.\n\n\n\n- Mail should \n\n\n- be part of my browser program. Aren\u0027t they the same app? There is a \ndifference? \n- be a separate application.\n\n\n\n\nNow to those people who want the full-blown functionality of the Mozilla trunk, \nyou can still get that with Phoenix. The idea is to relegate more features to \nthe \"optional add-on\" category. If you want the link toolbar or the sidebar or \nmouse gestures or any other features, you can download and install them \nyourself. I expect Phoenix will have a little add-in manager that will \nfacilitate this process. There is currently an expectation on the part of an \nalarming number of people that every feature implemented by anyone should \nautomatically be part of the default Mozilla install/download. \n\nWhy? \n\nA layered approach scales better. You can then have a browser that can become \nas complex as you want to make it, but the choice is left in your hands. The \ngeek features aren\u0027t inflicted on you by default.\n\nFinally, remember that Phoenix\u0027s UI is not controlled by Netscape. This is an \nopportunity for some of the core Mozilla Navigator developers to build the \nbrowser that they have always wanted to build, without having to compromise the \nuser interface to satisfy the various conflicting pressures exerted by factions \nwithin Netscape.\n\n[1] http://www.mozillanews.org\n[2] http://www.mozillazine.org\n\n",

    "message": "\nURL: http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/#85443841\nDate: Not supplied\n\nBug 22056 has to do with enabling different toolbar modes. It\u0027s a pretty basic \nbrowser feature that has been missing from Navigator for years. Even simplified \nbrowsers like Chimera have this feature. Neil did some excellent work in 22056 \nand his code finally landed. It naturally spiked startup time and window time \nslightly, and so it ended up being backed out because of Mozilla\u0027s no tolerance \npolicy for regressions.\n\nWhile this \"line in the sand\" policy is in many ways a good one, I feel like it \nmisses the point. There is a natural tendency when designing applications to \nadd features in every new version of the software. Only rarely do you see \nfeatures removed. With each passing version, you get more and more bloated, \nrelying on faster machines and more memory to save the day. Who cares if the \nuser interface is now full of 3000 menu items? You still support every last \nfeature since version 1.0, so no customers can possibly be dissatisfied!\n\nYou can really only cram so many features into a product before its size \nrequirements and performance requirements have to change. This is an obvious \nrule. It\u0027s like you start with an empty elevator that says \"Capacity: 10 \npeople.\" The elevator stops at the first floor (version 1.0) and a bunch of \npeople (features) get on. Continuing on its journey, the elevator stops at the \nsecond floor, and still more people get on. The elevator is now full, and it \ncontinues to the third floor (version 3.0). Unfortunately the elevator is full, \nbut there are a bunch of people waiting at the third floor to get on. Some of \nthem squeeze in anyway, past the fat user from the first floor (the Mozilla\nsidebar feature) who is taking up enough space for 3 people. Everyone wishes \nhe\u0027d get off at the third floor or even the fourth floor, but he doesn\u0027t. \nSomeone (the Mozilla wallet feature) from the second floor cuts one on the way \nto the third floor, so he\u0027s useless, and everyone wishes he\u0027d get off too. He \ndoesn\u0027t though. Nobody does. People keep piling in at floor after floor, until \neventually the elevator support cable snaps and everybody dies.\n\nWe need to forcibly eject people from the elevator. Remove the features that \nnobody wants and replace them with the features that matter. Cull out the \nfeatures that didn\u0027t work in Mozilla 1.0 and make sure they aren\u0027t there in \nMozilla 2.0. Make more of the features optional plugins so that geeks who want \nsome of the more obscure features (and that have powerhouse machines) can go \ndownload them on their own. Only if we actively fight the trend towards bloat \nwill we finally produce an awesome Mozilla browser.\n\n",

    "message": "\nURL: http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/#85409355\nDate: Not supplied\n\nBlake blogs[1] about how mpt[2] wants Mozilla to look just like MSIE. I have to \nadmit, the evidence is pretty compelling. I recall someone asking me, \"Do you \nreally agree with mpt\u0027s Top 10 list? He\u0027s quoted you at the top of the list!\"\n\nDo I agree that those ten items mpt mentions are the top ten problems? Of \ncourse not. No two people will have the same top ten problems. Also keep in \nmind that mpt and I can agree that something is a problem without necessarily \nagreeing on the solution to the problem. Maybe we have different ideas \nregarding how to solve a particular issue, but we at least both believe it is \nan issue that needs to be addressed. That\u0027s something.\n\nTo cover the list specifically:\n\n\n- Navigator chrome structure - While I don\u0027t necessarily agree with mpt\u0027s \nproposed default configuration, I do agree that the chrome structure is \npainfully restrictive, and that customizable toolbars need to be implemented in \norder for us to acquire the flexibility to deal with this problem.\n\n- Speed - can\u0027t argue with this, except to say that cutting out a lot of the \nuseless UI and features from the chrome helps substantially. Reduce bloat, gain \nspeed.\n\n- Text editing - if you use Chimera on the Mac, you\u0027ll see that the textfield \nwidget is easily the most painful part of the entire application. It\u0027s buggy, \nslow, misbehaves, and doesn\u0027t edit the way you\u0027d expect. This is IMO Chimera\u0027s \ntop usability problem.\n\n- Message display - Yes. No argument here.\n\n- Search - Yeah, it\u0027s a mess. Don\u0027t know if it would be in my top ten, but it\u0027s \na mess.\n\n- Menu structure - This gets back to my blog about how the apps should be \nseparated. The menu structure has been complicated in order to deal with \nmultiple applications. A clean separation naturally simplifies the menus (e.g., \nyou can eliminate the New submenu easily).\n\n- Migration - A problem, but IMO not one of the top ten facing Mozilla.\n\n- Context menus - mpt complains about two-click context menus, and yet, the OS \ndefault on Win32 (overwhelmingly) is to bring up a context menu on a mouse up. \nIf you don\u0027t like it, complain about Win32, but don\u0027t cite this as a Mozilla \nusability problem when we\u0027re following the conventions of the operating system. \n(We simply listen for the WM_CONTEXTMENU message. That message fires when Win32 \nwants to fire it.)\n\n- Validation - Err, no. Not a usability problem. To the average bear, this is \ncompletely irrelevant.\n\n- Preferences - IMO this should be much higher on the list. Preferences are a \ntangled pathetic mess. Again, separating prefs for individual apps into unique \ndialogs would simplify things a great deal, but we should also remove nearly \nhalf the preferences that exist from the GUI. Mozilla is ridiculously \noverconfigurable.\n\n\n\n[1] http://www.blakeross.com/archives/2002_08_18_index.html#80418641\n[2] http://mpt.phrasewise.com\n\n",

    "message": "\nURL: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/20020912.html\nDate: Not supplied\n\nWe\u0027re trying to decide if FogBUGZ[1] 3.0 should support custom fields. \nHistorically, I am opposed to custom fields in principle, because they get \nabused. People add so many fields to their bug databases to capture everything \nthey think might be important that entering a bug is like applying to Harvard. \nEnd result: people don\u0027t enter bugs, which is much, much worse than not \ncapturing all that information. You can always \"page fault\" to get the \ninformation if the original report forgot it. Rather than having a field in \nevery bug where you enter the version numbers of every DLL on your machine \n(this is an actual customer request), information which is likely to be \nrelevant only for a tiny percentage of bugs, why not just have the \nprogrammer-assignee look at the bug first, and if they think it might be \ndll-version-related, only _then_ bounce the bug back to the originator asking \nfor the DLL info? Similarly, it\u0027s always tempting to add a field in which you \nask for the OS version in which the bug occurred. This sounds logical, but \ntrust me: adding fields like this is guaranteed to do one thing and one thing \nonly: reduce the number of bug reports that get into the system in the first \nplace. Only a small percentage of bugs are really OS dependant and you can \nalways include that info in the text description of the bug if it happens to be \nrelevant. (But then how do you search for, say, all bugs which only happen on \nWindows 98SE? Aha! You can\u0027t. Ever. Even with the custom field. Because not \nevery bug has been regressed on every version of every operating system, so \nthis search doesn\u0027t make sense in the first place. The info wasn\u0027t captured. Do \na full text search for 98SE and you\u0027ll find some of them. Life is imperfect.) \n\nLife would be more perfect if every bug report included megabytes of \ninformation -- a complete dump of every byte on the hard drive and in RAM on \nthe computer in question and while you\u0027re at it, a photograph of the tester\u0027s \nworkspace. But the goal of a bug tracking database is to _keep track of bugs_, \nwhich, all else being equal, takes priority over making it easy to find them. I \nhave heard countless stories of development teams where the bug tracking \npackage was so high-ceremony that people were afraid to enter bugs in the \nsystem, because they didn\u0027t know what all those fields were. The _real_ \nbug-\"tracking\" happened in email, post-its, and hallway conversations. Great. \n\nA pretty common question we get on the customer service line is, \"does \nFogBUGZ support custom fields?\" Rather than giving our usual answer (\"no. on \npurpose.\") over the last few weeks I\u0027ve been saying, \"can you please tell me \nwhat fields you would need? We\u0027re trying to decide whether to implement that \nfeature in 3.0 and we want to know why people need it.\" The interesting thing \nis, almost all of the fields people ask for _are already in FogBUGZ,_ and the \nother ones, in my educated opinion, shouldn\u0027t be fields. And in fact, our \nexisting customers are certainly happy without custom fields. One of our \nbiggest site licenses was sold to a semiconductor company, and I myself wanted \nto add a custom field for them to keep track of versions of the circuit design, \nbut I didn\u0027t, and they never needed it (even though they had been keeping track \nof it with the old bug tracking package which had custom fields), and they are \nhappy and keep buying more site licenses. \n\nBut the dilemma for us is that many customers are evaluating bug tracking \nsoftware and they consider the lack of custom fields to be a major weakness in \nour product. \"Gosh, even Filemaker has custom fields.\" Righto. It\u0027s true. And \nwho am I to tell my customers they are wrong? One user who I was talking to\nyesterday would have used a custom field for something that we already have a \nbuilt-in field for. This would have made their database confusing and \ninconsistent and would have definitely caused more problems than it solved. But \nit\u0027s still rude of me to tell customers that we don\u0027t have that feature _for \ntheir own good_, even though it usually is, and we\u0027re losing some sales because \nof it. \n\nSigh. I guess we could have a custom fields feature but hide it and make it so \nhard to use that people don\u0027t use it. At least we won\u0027t lose any sales :)\n\n[1] http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBUGZ\n\n",

Product placements are one example of this. \n\nThere is an unfortunate tragedy of the commons, here. When advertising first \nrose to prominence, advertisements _did_ work. We hadn\u0027t built up our \nimmunities yet. As more and more advertisers used the opportunity of the medium \nto lie, we learned not to trust advertisements. But we still trust editorial. \nAnd once editorial gets polluted by desperate marketers using PR instead \nof advertising to promote their message, nobody will believe it either.\n\n[1] http://jrobb.userland.com/stories/2002/09/11/trustbasedAdvertising.html\n[2] http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060081988/ref\u003dnosim/joelonsoftware\n\n",

    "message": "\nURL: http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/#85378428\nDate: Not supplied\n\nI received some feedback in email (from several of you actually) regarding my \nearlier blog about the Parents Television Council[1], which recently published \na report in which they labeled Buffy as the worst show on television for \nchildren. Let me clarify why this organization bothers me so much.\n\nBuffy as a show is clearly inappropriate for children under 12, and a game like \nGTA3 is as well. The PTC, however, has a clear agenda that goes beyond simply \nwarning parents about the dangers of television shows or video games. There is \na belief on the part of the PTC that the hour from 8-9pm (the first hour of \nprimetime) must be designated a family hour, and that no offensive shows should \nair during that time. I don\u0027t believe that it\u0027s the networks\u0027 responsibility to \nrestrict the kind of content aired during a particular hour of television. The \nshows that air during primetime run the gamut; some are family-oriented and \nsome aren\u0027t. There is, however, no shortage of suitable content should parents \nand children wish to watch TV together during this hour.\n\nIt should be the parent\u0027s responsibility to police a child\u0027s television \nviewing. If you don\u0027t want your kids watching _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_, then \ndon\u0027t let them, but don\u0027t campaign to have the show removed from the air or \nshoved into a late hour that would only result in its cancellation just because \nyou don\u0027t like its content. If you don\u0027t think a show is appropriate, don\u0027t let \nyour kids watch it.\n\nThe PTC also seems to find shows offensive that are family-oriented. An example \nof one such show is _Malcolm in the Middle_. I would hardly call this show \ninappropriate for kids. Apparently the only shows that the PTC deems \nappropriate are those that have been sanitized to match their \nultra-conservative agenda. Even then, I wouldn\u0027t really mind, but the idea that \nall other shows must be relegated to some later hour is just ludicrous.\n\n[1] http://www.parentstv.org/\n\n",

    "message": "\nURL: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/20020910.html\nDate: Not supplied\n\nDaniel Berlinger has noticed[1] that Mac software shops are starting to move to \nOS X-only development. This makes sense, for two reasons. First, most people \nwho pay for software have new computers. So while OS X may only have a small \nfraction of the installed base, it has the majority of the population of people \nwho are opening their wallets. Second, if OS X isn\u0027t successful, the Mac is _\nover_. It\u0027s not like System 9 is getting any more popular. \n\nThen again, there are very few conditions under which it is actually the right \nbusiness decision to develop software for the Macintosh. Developing for the Mac \nis not a whole lot different than creating a web site _that only works on \nNetscape_. (Given the market share of Macs[2] (about 3.5%) and the market share \nof Netscape[3] (about 3.4%), that is not a silly comparison.) \n\nRobb Beal wrote[4]: \"Try this test. Go to a venture firm, angel, or big company \nwith a Mac OS X product/concept/prototype. Do they consider the fact that it\u0027s \na Mac application a net plus? (No.)\" Well _duh_. Your product would have to \nappeal to _25 times more Mac _users_ _[as a percentage] than Windows users just \nto break even. In other words, if your Windows product appeals to 1 in 100 \nWindows users, you have to appeal to 25 in 100 Mac users to make the same \namount of money. \n\nNow, you may want to make an _emotional_ appeal to developing for the Mac. \nThat\u0027s fine. If you like Macs and you\u0027re doing it for fun, more power to ya. \n\nBut as long as we\u0027re talking _investment_, you have to tell me why you\u0027re going \nto get 25 times as many users. Maybe there\u0027s less competition in your category \non the Mac; maybe you\u0027re in a niche like graphics where it seems like Macs \ndominate (they don\u0027t, it just seems that way because the elite graphics people \nin big American cities use Macs); maybe your product can\u0027t sell to mixed \nenvironments unless it runs everywhere. But if you want to make an investment \nin Mac software be prepared to demonstrate how you\u0027re going to overcome that \nmagic 25 multiplier.\n\n[1] http://archipelago.phrasewise.com/2002/09/10\n[2] http://maccentral.macworld.com/news/0207/03.marketshare.php\n[3] http://websidestory.com/cgi-bin/wss.cgi?corporate\u0026news\u0026press_1_193\n[4] http://radio.weblogs.com/0001123/2002/04/10.html\n\n",

Only a select few can say the same about \nAmanda Jones.\n\n-  My dear, since Eve picked the apple, no woman has ever been taken entirely \nunawares.\n\n-  This is Tommy. He tells people he\u0027s named after a gun, but I know he\u0027s named \nafter a famous 19th century ballerina.\n\n-  When one woman strikes at the heart of another she seldom misses, and the \nwound is invariably fatal.\n\n-  I\u0027ve never been alone with a man before, even with my dress on. With my \ndress off, it\u0027s _most_ unusual.\n\n-  You\u0027re nothing to me now. You\u0027re not a brother, you\u0027re not a friend. I don\u0027t \nwant to know you or what you do. I don\u0027t want to see you at the hotels, I don\u0027t \nwant you near my house. When you see our mother, I want to know a day in \nadvance, so I won\u0027t be there.\n\n-  Kids: 10 seconds of joy, 30 years of misery.\n\n-  Sucking all the marrow out of life doesn\u0027t mean choking on the bone.\n\n-  A hundred million terrorists in the world and I gotta kill one with feet \nsmaller than my sister.\n\n-  Mother, I do not need a blind date. Particularly not with some verbally \nincontinent spinster who drinks like a fish, smokes like a chimney and dresses \nlike her mother.\n\n-  Have you ever seen a body like this before in your life?\nShe happens to be my daughter.\nOh. Then I guess you have.\n\n-  I\u0027m not a smart man, but I know what love is.\n\n-  Of course, you won\u0027t be able to lie on your back for a while but then you \ncan lie from any position, can\u0027t you?\n\n-  The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn\u0027t change the fact that \nit was going to happen.\n\n-  Women need a reason for having sex. Men just need a place.\n\n-  You are not special. You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake. You are \nthe same decaying organic matter as everything else.\n\n-  Looks like I picked the wrong week to stop sniffing glue! \n\n-  The issue is not whether you are paranoid. Look around you Lenny. The issue \nis whether you are paranoid enough.\n\n-  Inconceivable!\nYou keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means. \n\nEnjoy.\n\n",

    "message": "\nURL: http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/#85443744\nDate: Not supplied\n\nI just finished reading an article about Mozilla[1] for Salon.com[2]. This \nexcerpt was rather amusing.\n\n_It is a good question, because in almost every way, Mozilla is a better \nbrowser than Navigator. For example, Netscape\u0027s best new feature, tabbed \nbrowsing -- which lets you have several Web pages open in the same browser \nwindow, and allows you to bookmark all the pages under one name -- was in \nMozilla many months ago, and the Mozilla project that created it (called \nMultiZilla) already has an improved version available. When asked about this, \nYecies, of Netscape, said, \"That\u0027s true, but the engineer who\u0027s working on it \n[for Mozilla] is a Netscape employee. It was always done with the intention of \nfostering general browsing usability for Netscape.\" \n_\nYes, ok, I suppose that\u0027s true if by \"Netscape employee\" you really meant \n\"Apple employee.\" and by \"always done with the intention of fostering general \nbrowsing usability for Netscape\" you meant \"was done in a weekend for Mozilla \nbecause I thought MultiZilla was cool.\" \n\nHere\u0027s how the whole tabbed browsing thing happened. One night I finally \ndownloaded an extension called MultiZilla (go check it out on mozdev.org[3]. I \nwas particularly impressed with a feature contained in MultiZilla called tabbed \nbrowsing. I started doing research and discovered NetCaptor[4], a tabbed \nbrowser that embedded WinIE. \n\nMultiZilla was cool but at the time suffered from two fundamental flaws that \nprevented the code from being incorporated into the Mozilla tree. The first was \na UI flaw, namely that at the time it had ripped off NetCaptor down to the last \ncontext menu item. The GUI was similar enough that there would have been \ndefinite concerns about so obviously copying some of NetCaptor\u0027s more obscure \ncapabilities (like sticky names and tab locking). The second concern was that \nthe tab behavior wasn\u0027t encapsulated cleanly into a widget. \n\nI produced a simplified version of tabbed browsing on my own time (did it in a \nweekend) that removed some of the geekier NetCaptor features and that \nencapsulated the tab behavior so that the changes to other Navigator files \nwould be minimal. Once I established that it didn\u0027t degrade performance in the \nsingle tab case, I checked it in as an experiment.\n\nThe response was overwhelming, as were the bugs that started being filed. So \nmuch so that at first I wanted to back tabbed browsing out of the tree. I was \noverruled by Mozilla, which turned out to be a good thing for all I think. :) \nEven with all the excitement and hoopla surrounding the advent of tabbed \nbrowsing on the engineering side (and in the Mozilla community), Netscape still \ndidn\u0027t get it. Netscape marketing prioritized all sorts of useless work that \nnobody had even started above tabbed browsing in their marketing document. They \ncontinued to do so for months, simply not getting it. It was this odd curiosity \nthat one of their engineers had checked in, and they didn\u0027t know what to make \nof it.\n\nOnly after the press raved about it did Netscape really jump on board. I\u0027m sure \nNetscape is doing the same thing now with popup blocking. Can\u0027t you just see it \nnow? We\u0027ll have a Popup Manager, and a Manager to manage the Popup Manager, and \ntwenty-seven preferences for fine-grained control of all aspects of popups. \n\nCan you believe how disfunctional Netscape is? When their engineers say \"you \nshould do this\" or \"you should do that\", they get completely ignored (or blown \noff), but when CNet says \"We didn\u0027t like this, or we didn\u0027t like that.\", \nNetscape scurries to meet their demands. That is simply pathetic.\n\n[1] http://archive.salon.com/tech/feature/2002/09/10/browser_wars/\n[2] http://www.salon.com\n[3] http://www.mozdev.org\n[4] http://www.netcaptor.com\n\n",

Turkey City is a venerable \nscience fiction workshop that has spawned many good writers and a lexicon of \nscience fiction critical terms that is the de facto standard for understanding \nwhat works and what doesn\u0027t in a work of science fiction: \n\n    Squid on the Mantelpiece \n\n    Chekhov said that if there are dueling pistols over the mantelpiece in the \n    first act, they should be fired in the third. In other words, a plot \n    element should be deployed in a timely fashion and with proper dramatic \n    emphasis. However, in SF plotting the MacGuffins are often so overwhelming \n    that they cause conventional plot structures to collapse. It\u0027s hard to \n    properly dramatize, say, the domestic effects of Dad\u0027s bank overdraft when \n    a giant writhing kraken is levelling the city. This mismatch between the \n    conventional dramatic proprieties and SF\u0027s extreme, grotesque, or visionary \n    thematics is known as the \"squid on the mantelpiece.\" \n\n    Card Tricks in the Dark \n\n    Elaborately contrived plot which arrives at (a) the punchline of a private \n    joke no reader will get or (b) the display of some bit of learned trivia \n    relevant only to the author. This stunt may be intensely ingenious, and \n    very gratifying to the author, but it serves no visible fictional purpose. \n    (Attr.

Jon Lebkowsky was there -- hell, he organized it -- and he \nblogged the hell out of the talk: \n\n    Entertainment industry has tradition of attacking technology: the piano \n    roll, the radio (sued by vaudeville), television (would destroy cinema!), \n    \"the Betamax affair\"... the latter being the first consumer VCR. In Betamax \n    case, argued that the ability to make a full copy of a broadcast work would \n    not be a fair use (in terms of copyright). It was illegal enough that the \n    VCR should be kept off the market, they argued. The Supreme Court got the \n    case, and the thing that shook out of it was the Betamax principle: a \n    technology is legal so long as it has substantial non-infringeing uses. \n    This principle is under attack. \n\n    Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 1998. Illegal to defeat a copyright \n    measure. Regionalization system for DVDs. This is a control that limits \n    distribution. John Johansen in Norway figured out how to break the content \n    scrambling system and allows you to move from one region to another, \n    override copy protection.

This \nweek, Dan takes Valenti\u0027s arguments apart, looking at what Hollywood\u0027s agenda \nreally entails: \n\n    So the movie and music companies are going back to Congress for another \n    helping. They are asking for laws that would force technology innovators to \n    restrict the capabilities of devices -- cripple PCs and other machines that \n    communicate so they can\u0027t make copies the copyright holders don\u0027t \n    explicitly allow. Amazingly, the entertainment industry also wants \n    permission to hack into networks and machines they believe are being used \n    to violate copyrights. \n\n    Here is what it all means. To protect a business model and thwart even the \n    possibility of infringement, the cartel wants technology companies to ask \n    permission before they can innovate. The media giants want to keep \n    information flow centralized, to control the new medium as if it\u0027s nothing \n    but a jazzed-up television. Instead of accepting, as they do today, that a \n    certain amount of penny-ante infringement will occur and then going after \n    the major-league pirates, they call every act of infringement -- and some \n    things that aren\u0027t infringement at all -- an act of piracy or stealing. \n    Saying it doesn\u0027t make it so.  \n\nLink[2] Discuss[3]\n\n[1] http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/business/columnists/dan_gillmor/4132447.htm\n[2] http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/4175607.htm\n[3] http://www.quicktopic.com/boing/H/WDUVXyKf9qUj\n\n",

    "message": "\nURL: http://boingboing.net/#85513221\nDate: Not supplied\n\nThe Joint Hearing of the Senate Committee and Senate Select Committee on the \nEntertainment Industry is underway in LA, investigating artists\u0027 claims that \nthe labels engage in unfair and corrupt business-practices. The first day\u0027s \nfindings at the hearings are really quite remarkable: \n\n    By contract, artists are prohibited from showing royalty statements to \n    third parties. Normally this would not include their mangers, lawyers, \n    consultants, or others who could aid them in getting paid, but apparently \n    this is not necessarily the case. Senator Kevin Murray, leading the \n    initiative for artists\u0027 rights, claimed the that Cary Sherman, Chief \n    Counsel for the RIAA himself, said to him in an interview, that RIAA \n    members (the major labels) would sue any artist that broke ranks and shared \n    information with the Committee. This claim was rejected by Sherman but \n    supported by others in the room. Don Henley, among them, outwardly dared \n    his record company to sue him for bringing royalty statements to the \n    hearing. He presented his most recent royalty statement for \"Hell Freezes \n    Over,\" which showed the panel that even though his contract called for a no \n    more than a 10% \"reserve\" on sales of records shipped, Universal Music had \n    held back more than that for eleven pay periods (roughly under three years) \n    and that, even though his contract calls for no free goods in Europe, they \n    had deducted $87,000 in free goods charges to Europe.  \n\nLink[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Paul!_)\n\n[1] http://www.musicdish.com/mag/?id\u003d6675\n[2] http://www.quicktopic.com/boing/H/jU9jRkFhUcp\n\n",

As soon as I\u0027m in San Francisco for more than a couple days straight, I \nreally think I\u0027m going to pick this up. \n\n    That\u0027s partly because it costs less than half as much as its current \n    competitors -- $199, compared with $450 and up for the others. In the same \n    spirit, T-Mobile will offer unlimited data usage on its new, relatively \n    high- speed \"GPRS\" network for $40 per month -- far below what a serious \n    surfer would likely rack up under competing wireless-data plans. (Voice \n    time is another story -- more on that later.) \n\n    Another reason I like the Sidekick\u0027s prospects: It was designed for, and \n    will be pitched to, a very different market. While vendors of the competing \n    hybrids focus on \"enterprise\" customers -- the big businesses that are \n    supposed to have deep pockets for this sort of thing (even though most \n    clearly don\u0027t at this point) -- Danger and T-Mobile are targeting, in their \n    own words, \"Internet-savvy, primarily urban, young adults in the 18- to \n    34-year-old demographic.\" \n\nI am that demographic!

    "message": "\nURL: http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/10/03.html#when_an_engineer_flaps_his_wings\nDate: 2002-10-03T01:31:51-05:00\n\nRemember that saying from chaos theory about how when a butterfly flap its \nwings, it can cause a hurricane a month later halfway around the world? As \nseveral people have already noted, Google has made some major changes in their \nmost recent update. The weblogging community was hit hard (for instance, I used \nto be the #1 \"mark\"[1]; I am now #6). The changes appear to be the result of an \nattempt to stop two phenomena: explicitly selling ads based on PageRank[2], and \nGoogle bombing[3]. \n\nSpecifically, Google is now apparently cross-checking link text with the linked \nsite, and discounting or ignoring links whose text does not appear in the \nlinked site. This all but kills off Google bombing. Searching for \"go to hell\"\n[4] no longer takes you to microsoft.com[5]; searching for \"talentless hack\"[6] \nno longer finds ohmessylife.com[7], although it finds a lot of people who were \npreviously participating in the Google bombing. No definitive word yet on \nwhether Google is actively penalizing such sites. \n\nUnfortunately, the algorithm tweaks necessary to stop these two techniques have \ncaused a wide range of collateral damage, apparently coming down hardest on \nmedium-to-large sites that had previously been doing everything right (as far \nas page structure, link structure, accessibility, and general honest hard work \nputting together a usable and useful site). The Webmasterworld forums are alive \nwith complaints and speculation: \n\n- New update, pagerank death?[8] \n- September 2002 Google Update Discussion - part 1[9] \n- Let\u0027s find out what happened - Sept 2002 Update - pt. 2[10] \n\n(Side note: amongst the confusion, it has been suggested that Google is no \nlonger indexing ALT text in images. I can confirm that this is absolutely \nfalse. Searching diveintomark.org for \"gimli\"[11] finds my entry of July 29[12]\n, where \"Gimli\" is mentioned only in the ALT text of an image.) \n\nRegardless, Google\u0027s search results in general appear to be significantly \ndegraded in many key areas. The forums are full of people complaining that spam \nsites, doorway pages, and obvious cloaking attempts, which Google used to be so \ngood at filtering out, are now popping up in top spots with disturbing \nfrequency. Nobody in the forums wants to talk about which keywords they\u0027re \ntracking, so I tried to find my own concrete example of crap search results. It \ndidn\u0027t take long. \n\n- Searching for reservation hotel[13] brings up an empty sub-page[14] of a \nhotel reservation company in Italy[15] as the first result. This seems \nunhelpful, and unlikely to be relevant to the average US-based consumer (and \nGoogle absolutely knows I\u0027m in the US based on my IP address). \n- Searching for news observer nc[16] (the News \u0026 Observer is a Raleigh, NC \nnewspaper) does find The News \u0026 Observer[17], but it also finds an Internet \nbetting spam page[18] at #7 and a non-existent page[19] at #9. \n- Searching for eminem[20] gives us two generic portal pages, a non-existent \nsite, and a site that redirects to a site that continuously redirects to itself \n(I am not making this up). And this is just on the first page. Good thing I \ndidn\u0027t care that much about Eminem to begin with, because Google just isn\u0027t \nthat helpful. \n\nMany people in the Webmasterworld forums are now suggesting that AllTheWeb.com\n[21] has better search results overall. Just as a single comparison, their \nresults for \"eminem\"[22] do appear to be much more relevant. Is this the \nbeginning of the end of Google\u0027s reign?\n\n\n\n[1]  http://www.google.com/search?q\u003dmark\n[2]  http://www.pradnetwork.com/affiliate.htm\n[3]  http://uber.nu/2001/04/06/\n[4]  http://www.google.com/search?q\u003d%22go+to+hell%22\n[5]  http://www.microsoft.com/\n[6]  http://www.google.com/search?q\u003dtalentless+hack\n[7]  http://www.ohmessylife.com/\n[8]  http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum3/5646.htm\n[9]  http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum3/5688.htm\n[10] http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum3/5723.htm\n[11] http://www.google.com/search?q\u003dgimli+site%3Adiveintomark.org\n[12] http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/07/29.html\n[13] http://www.google.com/search?q\u003dreservation+hotel\n[14] http://www.venere.it/home/italy.html\n[15] http://www.venere.it/\n[16] http://www.google.com/search?q\u003dnews+observer+nc\n[17] http://www.news-observer.com/\n[18] http://www.linkslsgolfworld.com/king-arthur-knight-of-the-round-table.htm\n[19] http://www.nando.net/nt/nao/\n[20] http://www.google.com/search?q\u003deminem\n[21] http://www.alltheweb.com/\n[22] http://www.alltheweb.com/search?query\u003deminem\n\n",

Filmmakers \n    such as Oskar Fischinger and Walther Ruttmann created some of the earliest \n    avant-garde films by multiplying, dividing, and otherwise transforming \n    abstract images- including spirals, rectangles, and circles to produce \n    dynamic rhythms and harmonies. Today such visual music and motion graphics \n    are the currency of digital graphics. Anthony McCall\u0027s film performances \n    such as Line Describing a Cone create 3-D geometric shapes into which the \n    viewer can literally step. We also explore films by pioneers of \n    machine-generated and computer-produced animation (Norman McLaren, James \n    and John Whitney, Stan Vanderbeek) as well as works by contemporary \n    animators who use the computer to either generate or pattern images (Larry \n    Cuba, Paul Glabicki, James Otis). Peter Kubelka, Taka Iimura, and Standish \n    Lawder use the frame as the unit with which they create editing patterns, \n    while Kurt Kren and Paul Sharits reckon on arithmetic systems to variously \n    calculate compositional or editing patterns. Bette Gordon, Hollis Frampton, \n    and Bruce Elder figure in algorithms, group theory, and set theory to \n    graphically enliven the frame or to structure their films. While no \n    mathematical knowledge is required to enjoy these films, we count on you to \n    try to calculate the mathematical systems employed!  \n\nLink[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Jef[3]!_)\n\n[1] http://www.msri.org/20thanniversary/cinemath.html\n[2] http://www.quicktopic.com/boing/H/Adiw2xL5kw8ug\n[3] http://www.acme.com\n\n",

    "message": "\nURL: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/20021002.html\nDate: Not supplied\n\nI\u0027ve been snowed under for the last four weeks, working on the FogBUGZ 3.0 \nSetup program. \n\nFor various reasons none of the commercial setup toolkits (Wise, InstallShield, \nWindows Installer) could do even 25% of what our setup program needed to do, so \nI ended up writing it from scratch. VC++ and MFC all the way. It took longer \nthan I expected because I had this weird conviction that the entire setup \nprocess should be completely reversable, and as you go backwards through the \nwizard it should automatically and silently undo any changes it had already \nmade. So even if you\u0027re looking at the last screen, if you decide you want to \nchange where to extract the files, you can just back up and change it and \neverything moves and all the old files you overwrote are put back and all the \nWindows accounts you created are uncreated and all the permissions we granted \nare ungranted and the SQL database you made is unmade and so on. The end result \nis a great setup program, but it may be a tad overkill. If I have time I\u0027ll \nwrite more about what I learned. \n\n  \n\nOne benefit of writing a setup program from scratch is that I don\u0027t have to \nhave someone else\u0027s stupid cartoon-of-a-computer-and-floppy-disks in the upper \nright hand corner. I used a photograph of the London Skyline, currently \ninfested with cranes.

Presumably because the presence of a tilde indicates with \nremarkable accuracy a personal site, and apparently her employer believes that \nreading personal sites is not an appropriate use of company time. Which, to be \nhonest, is probably accurate, given the nature of her work. But never mind \nthat. I don\u0027t want to talk about corporate politics. I want to talk about the \ntilde. \n\nEvery command-line-loving geek will tell you that ~ stands for \u0026#8220;home \ndirectory\u0026#8221;, and cd ~ will take you to your home directory. (cd ~username \nwill take you to someone else\u0027s, except on Mac OS X, where it will take you to \ntheir Public file sharing directory.) It is from this heritage that we can \ntrace the present-day practice of using tildes in URLs to denote personal \npages, since one single system-wide configuration allowed individual users to \nhave their own web sites by storing files in their own home directory. Or, more \ncommonly now that Apache has taken over the world, in their public_html \nsubdirectory, except on Mac OS X, where if you turn on web sharing and point \nyour browser to http://localhost/~username/, you\u0027re actually being served files \nfrom that user\u0027s Sites directory within their home directory. \n\nBut I don\u0027t want to talk about Mac OS X. I want to talk about the tilde. \n\nAs with so many other things, I find that Jukka Korpela[1] is the expert in \nthis field. Jukka is no doubt a member of my karass[2], a word which Google (\nold habits die hard[3]) feels is best explained by the personal site of Eugene \nWallingford, which, like Jukka\u0027s home page, can not be referenced without a \ntilde. \n\nIn fact, Jukka has written a lengthy treatise on why the tilde should not be \nused in URLs[4], a treatise which, I feel obliged to point out, contains a \ntilde in its URL. \n\nClearly, the tilde is underappreciated. \n\nDigging further, we find this post of Jukka\u0027s from 1998[5], in which we learn \nthat the tilde was not meant to be the tilde at all, but rather an odd \ncharacter called the overline. Presumably to balance out the underline, if \nindeed those sorts of things require balance. There is balance in the universe, \nto be sure, but I am less sure that it eminates from my keyboard. No matter. \nThe tilde was the tilde so that Spanish-typing types could type the \u0026ntilde; \n(now referenced in HTML as the named entity \u0026ntilde;), but somewhere along \nthe line, it morphed into a general-purpose character with all sorts of geeky \nuses. \n\nDigging even further, it appears that the tilde was originally an alternate for \n#[6], then an alternate for ^, and its life as an overline replacement came \neven later. Jukka confirms this[7] and adds a timeline: 1963 for #, 1964 for ^, \n1966 for overline. Then June 30, 1966, the watershed moment in an X3 committee \nmeeting, when it was proposed \u0026#8220;as exclusively a tilde in USA to appease \nSHARE\u0026#8221;. I can find no further reference as to what this acronym means, or \nwhat this committee meeting was about. The next reference isn\u0027t until 1991, \nwhen the tilde was officially added to ISO-646[8]. \n\nAnd now, down the rabbit hole we go. Scouring Usenet (which the kids of \nyesterday called \u0026#8220;Deja News\u0026#8221;, and kids today call \u0026#8220;Google \nGroups\u0026#8221;), we find a reprint of a 1991 William Safire (yes, _that_ William \nSafire) article On Language[9], in which we learn that ~ is officially \npronounced \u0026#8220;squiggle\u0026#8221;. This is confirmed by the Jargon Dictionary\n[10] to this very day. I\u0027m not sure this is useful, but I just thought it was \ncool to see William Safire writing about the proper pronunciation of various \nASCII characters. \n\nAs early as August 1990, tilde was included in the waka waka bang splat poem\n[11]. \n\nIn July 1989, Kermit gained support for filenames containing a tilde[12]. \n\nIn February 1988, an editor\u0027s note to an otherwise unrelated article notes that \nFidonet supported ASCII characters space through tilde[13]. \n\nAs early as January 1987, less used the tilde to denote lines past EOF[14]. \n\nAs early as July 1986, troff supported the tilde[15]. \n\nIn November 1985, a mod.sources post refers to Bourne shell enhancements \n(history,tilde,job control)[16]. \n\nAs early as January 1984, tilde was included on the DEC keyboard[17] and listed \nin the APL-11 character set[18]. \n\nIn April 1983, tilde was causing bugs in vi[19] (actually due to underlying \nbugs in csh). \n\nIn December 1982, ~ is officially pronounced \u0026#8220;tilde\u0026#8221;[20], prompting \nthis typographical pun[21]. \n\nAnd that\u0027s the earliest reference I can find. \n\nSo where does that leave us? Unsatisfied, no doubt. There is history here, but \nthere are gaps. What happened at that watershed meeting in 1966? How did the \ntilde rise to prominence in the 1980s? When did it become a synonym for \n\u0026#8220;home directory\u0026#8221;? When did it migrate into the world of web servers \nto provide a cheap and simple way of giving individual users their own web \nsites? I don\u0027t know, and the lateness of the hour prevents me from continuing \nmy research, a failing for which I apologize profusely. Goodnight, goodnight. \nMay you dream of tildes, stars, and whorls.\n\n\n\n[1]  http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/\n[2]  http://www.cs.uni.edu/~wallingf/personal/bokonon.html#words\n[3]  http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/10/03.html#when_an_engineer_flaps_his_wings\n[4]  http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/tilde.html\n[5]  http://groups.google.com/groups?selm\u003d3627ac95.66099519%40news.cs.hut.fi\n[6]  http://groups.google.com/groups?selm\u003dan_600051281\n[7]  http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/latin1/ascii-hist.html#7E\n[8]  http://czyborra.com/charsets/iso646.html\n[9]  http://groups.google.com/groups?selm\u003d735627391.AA02027%40Clone.his.com\n[10] http://info.astrian.net/jargon/terms/a/ASCII.html\n[11] http://groups.google.com/groups?selm\u003d14595%40shlump.nac.dec.com\n[12] http://groups.google.com/groups?selm\u003dCMM.0.88.616446576.cmg%40watsun.cc.columbia.edu\n[13] http://groups.google.com/groups?selm\u003d4036%40hoptoad.uucp\n[14] http://groups.google.com/groups?selm\u003d669%40kodak.UUCP\n[15] http://groups.google.com/groups?selm\u003d3197%40jhunix.UUCP\n[16] http://groups.google.com/groups?selm\u003d2428%40cal-asd.fluke.UUCP\n[17] http://groups.google.com/groups?selm\u003d778%40brl-bmd.UUCP\n[18] http://groups.google.com/groups?selm\u003d2405%40decwrl.UUCP\n[19] http://groups.google.com/groups?selm\u003dbnews.ucf-cs.904\n[20] http://groups.google.com/groups?selm\u003dbnews.ucbcad.162\n[21] http://groups.google.com/groups?selm\u003dbnews.hp-pcd.546\n\n",

When you \n    phone a cab firm in San Francisco, your call is treated not as an order, \n    not as a binding oral contract, but simply as a request... \n\n    So, why don\u0027t cab companies ensure that we pick you up on time-or at all? \n    In a nutshell, labor law states that if a cab company actually commands a \n    driver to carry out a specific action, that constitutes an \n    employer-employee relationship. But if a company farms its work out to \n    independent contractors, it can rid itself of costly expenses such as \n    disability and social security taxes. It also means that the contractor \n    drivers can\u0027t unionize.  \n\nLink[1] Discuss[2] (_via CamWorld[3]_)\n\n[1] http://www.bradnewsham.com/articles/why_so_hard.shtml\n[2] http://www.quicktopic.com/boing/H/eXFeCJHgnP4\n[3] http://www.bradnewsham.com/articles/why_so_hard.shtml\n\n",

In recent months, the \n    company changed its name and launched an ad campaign featuring Ms. Zeta \n    Jones. \n\n    The company has a history worth hiding. T-Mobile, a subsidiary of Deutsche \n    Telekom, is known for having a weak national network, and the FCC received \n    1,466 complaints about the company in the past year, giving it one of the \n    worst complaint rates in the industry. T-Mobile says their complaint rate \n    has tapered off and that they have made substantial network improvements. \n\n    But T-Mobile is the cheapest wireless provider, available, with an average \n    cost of just 8.2 cents per minute. (Verizon, by contrast, costs 14.3 cents \n    per minute.)  \n\nLink[1] Discuss[2] (_via Camworld[3]_)\n\n[1] http://www.msnbc.com/news/816517.asp\n[2] http://www.quicktopic.com/boing/H/VKy7KfS2A7jUZ\n[3] http://www.camworld.com\n\n",

As \nmany of you may have found out or guessed, I will be attending oral argument \nfor the Eldred case[2] before the Supreme Court. \n\nI\u0027m incredibly excited, as you might imagine. Visiting the Supreme Court would \nbe quite enough, but seeing such an important case...Dayenu! When Lessig asked \nme if I was free that day to come, I laughed because I couldn\u0027t (and still \ncan\u0027t) think of anything I\u0027d rather do than attend. I am eternally grateful to \nLessig for the chance to attend. On the other hand, I\u0027m sort of embarassed to \nhave the opportunity, when there are surely others who deserve it far more than \nme. Luckily, it seems that such deserving others will be able to get seats by \ncamping in line with us. \n\nSo, I\u0027ll be arriving in D.C. on Tuesday, attending an \nEldred/Duke/EPIC/Bookmobile superparty, and then camping in line with Seth \nSchoen[3], Lisa Rein, Jace Cooke but unfortunately not Cory Doctorow. If you\u0027d \nlike to come with us, let me know. \n\nI was hoping I\u0027d be able to take notes and post them to my weblog for those who \ncouldn\u0027t make it, but as I read in today\u0027s Times, only lawyers and those with \nofficial press credentials are allowed to take notes![4] I think this is \noutrageous, but hopefully I will be able to remember enough to provide an \ninteresting account. \n\nIn a related irony, today was \"Disney Day\" at Borders[5], where they played \nDisney rock songs with the volume turned up too loud, disturbing my usual habit \nof reading a book there. However, I did manage to skim through _The Practice of \nProgramming_. \n\nIn an unrelated note, if you haven\u0027t been electrocuted by a Model T spark plug, \nI highly recommend it.\n\n\n\n[1] http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000609\n[2] http://eldred.cc/\n[3] http://vitanuova.loyalty.org/2002-10-02.html\n[4] http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/05/opinion/05AMAR.html\n[5] http://www.bordersstores.com/events/event_detail.jsp?SEID\u003d15127444\n\n",

The idea of football players playing \nthemselves in licensed video games is neat and recursive, like the episode of \nthe Simpsons when Mr. Burns runs into Krusty buying Krusty-O\u0027s at the \nsupermarket and asks where he can find the \"Burns-O\u0027s.\" \n\n    \"It\u0027s always a trip,\" Carr says. \"The first time I saw myself in a video \n    game was in college (at Fresno State) when I walked into a Best Buy store \n    and some kid was playing with me.

We even flew Mullah Omar to Texas to try and convince \nhim. After it was clear that wouldn\u0027t work, we threatened to bomb them and \nbegun attacking on a smaller scale for a year before 9-11. We already planned \nto invade two months before the attacks. While it\u0027s not clear they knew about \n9-11 it certainly provided a convenient cover for their plans. \n\nThree days after we started bombing, we begun official work on the pipeline \nKarzai, the Afghanistan president we installed (who incidentally used to work \nfor the oil company Unocal and was a former Talib) focused on the pipeline \nrather than rebuilding his torn country. Yet, the entire pipeline is unworkable \nbecause it\u0027s too expensive and will be sabotaged by warlords and Pakistan. \n\nBin Laden was essentially a venture capitalist: he funded attacks but didn\u0027t \ncarry them out. It\u0027s far more likely that an Egyptian group, Islamic Jihad, \ncarried out the attacks. If we wanted to stop the terrorists, we should have \ngone after them. If we wanted to stop anti-Americanism, we should have gone \nafter Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Instead, our bombing created the perfect \nopportunity for Bin Laden to escape. Nor did we bother to stabilize \nAfghanistan, the country is as ruined as ever. \n\n\"Unfortunately, our government seized the moment as well, not to do good or \nright, but to take advantage--of our grief, of our naivete, of our lust for \njustice and vengeance. They did it to line the pockets of themselves and their \nfriends, to gain political and economic advantage for a tiny coterie of \ninfluential people. In doing so, they endangered the rest of us. They took \nadvantage of our ignorance about Islam, Caspian Sea oil and remote Central \nAsia. I have faith that the fundamental goodness of the American people will \ncause them to see what was done in their name, and to do something about it.\"\n\n\n\n[1] http://www.comicbookgalaxy.com/pipeline0.html\n\n",

Open the DVD (it appears on the desktop) and drag the VIDEO_TS folder to \nyour hard drive. Ejct the DVD.\n3. In DVD Player, select \"Open VIDEO_TS Folder...\" from the File menu. Use the \ndialog that appears to select the VIDEO_TS folder on your hard drive. \n\nNow the DVD plays just like it would were the DVD in the drive. By extension, I \ncould also put the DVD up on my site for you to download and watch. I could \nshare it via a P2P network. And I haven\u0027t done anything to decrypt the DVD or \nviolate the DMCA: I\u0027ve used only basic tools available to all normal computer \nusers on my (I assume) fully-licensed consumer laptop. \n\n*Disclaimer:* Seth Schoen, whose opinion I highly respect on these matters, \nfinds it unlikely that the DVD was CSS-encrypted if this was possible. I am not \nsure how to verify if the DVD is CSS-encrypted. If someone has a suggestion, \nplease let me know. However, if it is true, then it\u0027s very interesting that \nDisney has released such a major movie without encryption.\n\n\n",

I say \nhalf-hearted because I\u0027m still application-centric, and I don\u0027t go as far with \nkeyboard shortcuts as I could. But I don\u0027t use the desktop at all (never have, \non any system), and I don\u0027t use ctrl alt keyboard shortcuts because I \npersonally find them awkward (YMMV). If you must use Windows, the first step \ntowards a productive system is managing your Start menu. \n\nI use the main level of the Start menu with numbered shortcuts to my most \ncommon programs. \"0 Control Panel[3]\", \"1 Mozilla[4]\", \"2 Emacs[5]\", \"3 DOS \nhome\", \"4 DOS work\", \"5 DOS incoming\" (each of which gives me a command line, \nbut in different directories), \"7 Python[6]\", \"9 IE\". Also \"# Explorer home\", \n\"$ Explorer work\", \"% Explorer incoming\", which open Explorer windows in \nvarious useful directories (the same directories as the DOS shortcuts, only \nwith the shift key held down, and yes, I intentionally set it up so that $ went \nto my work folder). Less-used programs are taken out of their useless submenus \n(as installed) and moved directly into the Programs submenu and given unique \nfirst letters as needed. \"Ad-aware[7]\", \"Excel[8]\", \"IM\", \"Netscape 4[9]\", \n\"Paint Shop Pro\", \"Query Tool (ODBC)[10]\", \"VMWare[11]\", \"Word[12]\". All other \nsubmenus except Startup are removed from the Programs menu. (Yes, delete \n\"Accessories\". Do you honestly ever use it? If so, it\u0027s probably a sign of a \nlarger productivity problem.) Things which never need to be run manually (like \nWinZip and Quicktime) are removed from the Programs menu. Maintaining a clean \nPrograms menu is an ongoing struggle, but well worth it. \n\nOn most modern keyboards, there is a key next to your left alt key that opens \nthe start menu, which you can press with your left thumb without taking your \nfingers off the home keys. Otherwise ctrl esc always works. Menu 4 gives me a \nnew command prompt in my work directory. Menu P N runs Netscape 4 (for \ncompatibility testing in my day job, ugh). Mozilla and Emacs are almost always \nopen, but I quit lesser-used applications as soon as I\u0027m done using them \n(mostly because my laptop doesn\u0027t have a lot of memory). \n\nI install Cygwin[13] so that the command line is actually useful. Cygwin is a \ncollection of Windows ports of all your favorite UNIX utilities, including mv, \ncp, scp, ssh, man, tar, less, grep, patch, ncftp, cvs, and many others. And \nbash, which I don\u0027t use because I dislike how it handles Windows pathnames. I \nalso set the properties of my command line shortcuts to set the window size to \n120 x 50 (almost full screen at 1024 x 768), and screen buffer size to 120 x \n3000. Set window position at 0 x 0, and don\u0027t let the system position the \nwindow. \n\nIn Mozilla, I set my home page to \"about:blank\", set Internet Search to search \nwith Google, use Tabbed Browsing, open tabs instead of windows in all possible \ncases, always show the tab bar, and load links in the background (essential for \nweblog surfing, you can ctrl click links to open them in new tabs in the \nbackground). Under Scripts \u0026 Plugins, I do not allow scripts to open \nunrequested windows. I turn off the sidebar, turn on the Site Navigation Bar, \ndelete all pre-installed bookmarks, and create two bookmarks: one which takes \nme to my webmail, and another which takes me to my internal site search[14], \nfrom which I can find all other bookmarks I need. \n\nIn Internet Explorer, I set my home page to the page to edit my weblog, since \nthat\u0027s the only thing I do in Internet Explorer. alt tab back and forth between \nMozilla and IE is easier than ctrl pgup/pgdown between tabs within Mozilla, \nsince TEXTAREAs in Mozilla lose focus when you switch tabs, making copying and \npasting weblog entries virtually impossible. \n\nI use Emacs locally and vi remotely, because the default behavior of Emacs is \nso heinous as to render it unusable. (For instance, editing a CGI script named \nfoo.cgi on a web server with Emacs would generate a foo.cgi~ backup file, which \nis world-readable and is sent as plain text to any browser that asks. Try this \nsometime on your favorite web site.) Among other things, my .emacs file (which \nis actually called _emacs on Windows) instructs Emacs to store all backup files \nin a single directory (d:\\backup); to treat all XML files as DocBook, all CGI \nscripts as Python, and all SQL scripts as PL/SQL; to use Cygwin\u0027s bash shell \nfor M-x-shell; to use a single maximized frame with no menubar, titled as the \nname of the current file; to show column numbers; to accept \"y\" and \"n\" for \nyes/no questions; not to blink; not to beep; and to close the current file when \nI press M-w. I use some weird registry hacks and a hacked notepad.exe to get \nall text files to open in Emacs. (I got this idea from Ultraedit[15].) My \n_emacs file is my second most backed-up possession. \n\nI don\u0027t use Windows\u0027 useless directory structure for user home directories. On \nmy D drive I have d:\\home (contains directories for my books and other personal \nprojects, each under CVS control\u0026#8212;also set as my home directory using the \nHOME environment variable), d:\\work (contains directories for each work \nproject, also under CVS), d:\\incoming (set as default download directory for \nall programs that download things), and d:\\backup (used by Emacs, and for \ntemporary storage, for instance for storing originals when checking out newly \ncreated CVS projects). I don\u0027t know or care what\u0027s where on my C drive. \n\nI have tried many, many address books, and still store all my contacts, email \naddresses, snail mail addresses, phone numbers, and other vital personal \ninformation in a text file called phone, stored in d:\\home\\phone. It is not in \nany particular format, other than being plain text and usually including blank \nlines between entries. I categorize people with simple keywords in parentheses \nafter their name, and use M-x-occur in Emacs to search by keyword. This file is \nmy single most backed-up possession. \n\nOther essential free Windows utilities I use (in no particular order): TweakUI\n[16], Cygwin[17], Guidescope[18], ZoneAlarm[19].\n\n\n\n[1]  http://bitworking.org/Oct2002.html#X631695997519494480\n[2]  http://www.winterspeak.com/columns/082001.html\n[3]  http://www.annoyances.org/exec/show/article02-013\n[4]  http://www.mozilla.org/\n[5]  http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/ntemacs.html\n[6]  http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePython/\n[7]  http://www.lavasoftusa.com/\n[8]  http://www.openoffice.org/\n[9]  http://sillydog.org/narchive/\n[10] http://gpoulose.home.att.net/\n[11] http://www.vmware.com/\n[12] http://www.openoffice.org/\n[13] http://www.cygwin.com/\n[14] http://diveintomark.org/mt/mt-search.cgi\n[15] http://www.ultraedit.com/downloads/index.html#notepad\n     Replacing Notepad with Ultraedit-32\n[16] http://www.microsoft.com/ntworkstation/downloads/PowerToys/Networking/NTTweakUI.asp\n[17] http://www.cygwin.com/\n[18] http://www.guidescope.com/\n[19] http://download.com.com/3000-2092-10039884.html?part\u003dzonealarm\u0026subj\u003ddlpage\n\n",

Unlike \neveryone else, they decided to search my suitcase. The security lady asked for \npermission and then took everything out: clothing, umbrellas, a jacket, and a \nbox of crackers. She searched all the pockets: nothing. Apparently the jacket \nwas suspicious; She sent it through again. Nothing. \n\n    The lady in the next lane waved a 10-inch knife and asked the lady in my \n    lane if it could go on. I can only assume she answered yes. \n\nShe put everything back in and sent it through again. Still suspicious. They \ntook everything out. It looked like this was going to take a while, so I used \nthe opportunity to put the tickets I was holding back in my bag. When I looked \nback up, the security woman was brandishing a scissors and saying \"This can\u0027t \ngo on board.\" \"I don\u0027t remember packing that,\" I said. I let her confiscate it. \n\nI called my Mom. She doesn\u0027t remember packing it either. Is there some sort of \nterrorist plot to plant scissors in innocent-looking people\u0027s suitcases? I \ncan\u0027t see why this would be useful. How would they know what plane I\u0027m on? Once \nI\u0027m on the plane how would they get the scissors? They could threaten me, but \nif they have a threatening implement already, then why do they need the \nscissors? Perhaps it\u0027s some sort of Matroishca-doll system. They use their \nfists to get the infant to give them the squeaky mouse, they use the squeaky \nmouse to scare the toddler into giving them a copy of _A New Kind of Science_, \nthey use ANKS to bludgeon a 5th Grader into giving them a wedge block, and they \nuse the wedge to get me to give them the scissors. Those are some pretty clever \nterrorists. \n\n*Update:* False alarm. My Mom called. Apparently it was the scissors she was \nusing to cut loose threads from my tie last night. It must have fallen in. The \nnation can go back to Yellow Level Terrorist Alert.  \n\n\u003d\u003d\u003d Waiting for Wireless \u003d\u003d\u003d \n\nNow I am at O\u0027Hare Airport, sitting outside the Admiral\u0027s Club while \nbusinessmen walk in and out. I am looking for a wireless signal, the signal I \nused last time I was here, but not finding it. Of course, last time I was here, \nI had an Admiral\u0027s Club card. This time I have a Mileage Plus Card, but despite \nthe airline ologopoly--or perhaps because of it (have to keep up appearances, \nyou know)--I doubt they will accept it. \n\n\u003d\u003d\u003d Irony \u003d\u003d\u003d \n\nAccording to the announcement I just heard, Mr. Valenti is going to miss his \nflight. \n\nI think of what I\u0027d say if I ran into him. \"Jack!\" I\u0027d exclaim, as if we were \nold pals. \"Going to the Eldred case?\" Of course he was. \"Going to be a good \none.\" \"Hey, remember when you had that debate with Lessig?\" I\u0027d ask. \"You said \nyou were starting a new task force to make movies legitimately available on the \nInternet. What ever happened to that?\" I imagine him mumbling and looking down \nat his watch. His plane is going to leave soon; he has to run. \n\nAnother announcement: Mr. Michael McKenna needs to call his office. Good thing \nthese airline announcements keep me up to date. \n\n\u003d\u003d\u003d Automatic Flush Toilets \u003d\u003d\u003d \n\nNow I am short and the sensing system was mounted up tall in both instances. In \nthe first, at my old high school (where you think some people might be a little \nshort...), the flush went off once accidentally. OK, I thought, I can handle \none mistake. Then it went off again. Here at the airport, it misfired three \ntimes. \n\nThis is annoying and inexcusable. Have they not heard of user testing? Do they \nexpect only tall people to use these bathrooms? This problem must be remedied \nimmediately. I recommend releasing a Service Pack on the manufacturer\u0027s web \nsite. \n\n\u003d\u003d\u003d Arrival \u003d\u003d\u003d \n\nI\u0027ve arrived in D.C.--once again, I\u0027m sitting a block away from my hotel on the \nsidewalk borrowing someone\u0027s connection. Trip was very smooth, had lunch with \nLisa and went to the Spy Museum (pretty cool, but could have been better). Now \nfor the meetings and parties. \n\nSorry for not responding to your email. I\u0027m rather busy. ;-)\n\n\n",

    "message": "\nURL: http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/10/08.html#in_praise_of_evolvable_formats\nDate: 2002-10-08T12:28:10-05:00\n\n_Clay Shirky_: In Praise of Evolvable Systems[1]. This entire article could be \nrewritten to explain RSS. In fact, let\u0027s do that. \n\nIf it were April Fool\u0027s Day, the Net\u0027s only official holiday, and you wanted to \ndesign a \u0026#8220;novelty format\u0026#8221; to slip by the W3C as a joke, it might \nlook something like RSS 0.9x/2.0: \n\n- It would specify limits on data values, then remove them, then specify \nrequired elements, then make them optional, thus silently breaking an unknown \nnumber of parsers around the world. \n- It would encourage use of entity-encoded HTML in its most important element, \nthus ensuring both security risks and unpredictable display for the end user. \n- It would ignore years of standards work in other fields, committing such \negregious sins as defining a guid element that wasn\u0027t a GUID, and using an \nobsolete date format that couldn\u0027t easily be sorted by date. \n- Its primary method of extensibility would be to add new elements to the core \nnamespace without telling anyone or documenting them, thus making it wholely \nresistant to DTD, schema, or validation of any kind. \n- After years of worldwide deployment, it would completely reverse its \nadd-whatever-you-want extensibility rules in favor of namespaces, which the \nspec would neither define nor elaborate on. \n- After adopting namespaces, it would fail to deprecate any existing elements \nsemantically identical to namespace elements already in wide use. It would also \nfail to provide precedence rules in cases where a document attempted to say the \nsame thing in two different ways, thus ensuring mass confusion among producers \nand inconsistent behavior across consumers. \n\nRSS 0.9x and 2.0 are the Whoopee Cushion and Joy Buzzer of syndication formats. \nFor anyone who has tried to accomplish anything serious with metadata, it\u0027s \npretty obvious that of the various implementations of a worldwide syndication \nformat, we have the worst one possible. \n\nExcept, of course, for all the others. \n\nThe problem with that list of RSS deficiencies is that it is also a list of \nnecessities\u0026#8212;RSS has flourished in a way that no other syndication format \nhas, not despite many of these qualities but because of them. The very \nweaknesses that make RSS so infuriating to serious practitioners also make it \npossible in the first place. \n\n- Removing length limitations on description and making title optional opened \nup RSS to a whole new category of producer: the weblogger. \n- Allowing encoded HTML in description let publishers reuse both their existing \ncontent and the existing RSS infrastructure, without requiring them to produce \nvalid XHTML (which could be embedded directly into an XML document). Social \nmores, rather than technical rules, prevent producers from intentionally \nintroducing security risks through malicious script tags or unpredictable \ndisplay through unclosed HTML elements. \n- Few publishing tools can produce real conforming GUIDs, and it doesn\u0027t \nmatter, because virtually all RSS parsers are written in high level languages \nwhere handling strings is more efficient than converting strings to bytecodes \nand handling bytecodes. As for dates, by convention an RSS document is laid out \nin reverse chronological order, and no one seems to be clamoring for more \nflexibility. \n\nFurthermore, its almost babyish XML syntax, so far from any serious \ncomputational framework (Where are the namespaces? Where is the Document Type \nDescription? Why is the aggregators\u0027 enforcement of conformity so lax?), made \nit possible for anyone wanting an RSS feed to write one. The effects of this \nease of implementation only become clear when you compare it to the attempts \nover the years to \u0026#8220;do RSS right\u0026#8221;\u0026#8212;most notably RSS 1.0 in the \nyear 2000. RSS 1.0 had three main benefits: \n\n- Backward compatible with RSS 0.90, which was never widely deployed, and which \nfell into obscurity as soon as (the much simpler) RSS 0.91 was introduced. \n- Based on RDF (specifically a serialization called RDF/XML), a spec which, at \nthe time and to this day, continues to change or threaten to change. Two years \nlater, there are no major languages or development platforms that ship with \nparsers to consume RDF, although many (Perl, Python, .NET) have third-party RDF \nparsers in various states of development and conformance. (The release version \nis generally out of date; CVS access is recommended. You get the idea.) \nMeanwhile, RDF/XML production tools are so inconsistent that even RDF experts \nrecommend not using RDF tools to produce an RSS 1.0 feed if you want it to \nactually be read by any major RSS aggregator. Despite the two-year-old promise \nof better tools[2], it is now the year 2002, and I built my RSS 1.0 \nfeed\u0026#8212;in the most sophisticated personal publishing system in the \nworld\u0026#8212;by manually typing a mishmash of template tags and angle brackets \ninto a TEXTAREA of an HTML form. \n- Extensible through namespaces, which, as mentioned above, have been \nhaphazardly and poorly incorporated into RSS 2.0, where they appear to be \nflourishing. \n\nEvolvable formats\u0026#8212;those that proceed by being adapted and extended in a \nthousand small ways\u0026#8212;have three main characteristics that are germane to \ntheir eventual victories over strong, centrally designed formats. \n\n- Only solutions that produce partial results with imperfect tools can succeed. \nMy RSS feed is an XML document produced by a template that I built in a \nTEXTAREA, and consumed by hundreds of parsers around the world that know \nnothing of XML and hack apart my feed with regular expressions. The world is \nlittered with formats that would have worked if only everyone had better tools. \nIf everyone in the world had a perfect RDF parser at their disposal, it would \nbe trivial to produce and consume all the world\u0027s metadata in RDF. Without such \nperfect tools, both production and consumption instantly become nightmares. \nThere is no middle ground. \n- What is, is wrong. Because evolvable formats have always been adapted to \nearlier conditions and are always being further adapted to present conditions, \nthey are always behind the times. RSS was being stretched with long \ndescriptions, optional titles, and entity-encoded HTML even before such \npractices were codified in the spec, and long before all consumers could handle \nthem. No evolving format is ever perfectly in sync with the challenges it \nfaces. \n- Finally, Orgel\u0027s Rule, named for the evolutionary biologist Leslie \nOrgel\u0026#8212;\u0026#8220;Evolution is cleverer than you are\u0026#8221;. As with the list \nof RSS\u0027s obvious deficiencies above, it is easy to point out what is wrong with \nany evolvable system at any point in its life. No one seeing RSS 1.0 and RSS \n0.91 side-by-side could doubt that RSS 1.0 had the superior technology, that it \n\u0026#8220;did things right\u0026#8221;. However, the ability to understand what is \nmissing at any given moment does not mean that one user or a small central\ngroup can design a better system in the long haul. \n\nDesigned formats start out strong and improve logarithmically. Evolvable \nformats start out weak and improve exponentially. RSS 2.0 is not the perfect \nsyndication format, just the best one that\u0027s also currently practical. \nInfrastructure built on evolvable formats will always be partially incomplete, \npartially wrong and ultimately better designed than its competition.\n\n\n\n[1] http://www.shirky.com/writings/evolve.html\n[2] http://groups.yahoo.com/group/syndication/message/467\n\n",

    "subject": "Feedback from my posting about FogBUGZ Setup fell into four",
    "message": "\nURL: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/20021008.html\nDate: Not supplied\n\nFeedback from my posting[1] about FogBUGZ[2] Setup fell into four categories. \n\n*\"Why make Setup reversable? Instead you should collect all the information \nfrom the user and make all the changes in one batch at the end.\"* There are a \ncouple of things to understand here. First of all, even if you do everything in \none batch at the end, there\u0027s always a possibility that some step in the middle \nof the batch will fail, and in that case, a well-behaved setup program will \nback out the steps that were already done. There are well over 100 error \nmessages in the string table for FogBUGZ Setup so the number of things that can \nfail is not insignificant. \n\nSecond, it\u0027s not nice to tell people about an error in their input three pages \nafter they made the mistake. For example, early in the FogBUGZ setup process we \nprompt you to create an account for FogBUGZ to use: \n\n[IMG: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/pictures/setupNewAcct.gif (FogBUGZ Setup \nScreenshot)] \n\nThe account creation could fail for a myriad of reasons, none of which can be \npredicted before trying to create the account. For example, the password might \nnot conform to the system password policy. And different national versions of \nWindows NT have different rules about accented letters in passwords (betcha \ndidn\u0027t know that!). It\u0027s better to tell the user about this problem right away \nso they can correct their input rather than having a message come up during the \nlong install process later, forcing the user to back up and fix it. And even if \nyou force the user to back up and fix it, you still have to undo the first part \nof the work that you did before creating the account, otherwise you\u0027ve left \ntheir system in an indeterminate state. \n\nIn any case I need to write code to create the account and delete the account \nin case something later fails; I might as well call that code on this page of \nthe wizard where I can display a useful error message. \n\nAnd what are the kinds of things that need to be reversable? Well, in order to \nupgrade FogBUGZ without requiring a reboot (and we _never, ever _require a \nreboot), we have to shut down a couple of processes that might have been \nkeeping FogBUGZ files pinned down, such as IIS (Microsoft\u0027s web server). So \npart one of the batch is \"Stop IIS.\" Now if part 2 fails for some reason, it \nwould be _extremely_ rude to leave IIS not running. And anyway, it\u0027s not like I \ndon\u0027t need to write the code for \"Start IIS\" for the end of the batch. So the \ncode to rollback \"Stop IIS\" is already written. No big deal, I just need to \ncall it at the right place. \n\nI think one reason that people think you should \"gather all the info and then \ndo all the work\" is because with very large installation programs that are very \nslow, this is a polite way to waste less of the user\u0027s time. Indeed even \nFogBUGZ setup does 95% of its work at the very end. But the \"create account\" \noperation is so fast, that principle simply doesn\u0027t apply here. Even our 95% of \nthe work phase takes well under a minute, most of which is spent waiting for \nIIS to stop and start. \n\n*\"Why did you use VC++/MFC? Surely an advanced intelligence such as yourself \nhas admitted by now that Delphi[3] is more productive.\"* First of all, leave \nyour language religious fanaticism at the Usenet door. Somehow I managed \nto figure out_ in high school_ that language advocacy and religious \narguments are unbelievably boring.  \n\nSecondly, even if Delphi were more productive, the only pertinent question, \nsince I am writing the code, is _what is more productive for Joel Spolsky_. And \nI don\u0027t know Delphi at all, but I know Win32, MFC, and VC++ _really, really \nwell_. So while I might not outcode a good Delphi programmer, I would \ndefinitely outcode a completely inexperienced Delphi programmer (which is me), \ncertainly over a short 4 week project. Third, many of the things I needed to do \nin this setup program are things like \"grant the Logon as Service privilege to \nan account.\" This is rare enough that the only way to find out how to do this \nis to search the Microsoft knowlege base and the web in general. When you \nsearch the web in general for how to do fancy things with Windows NT, what you \nfind is about 75% C code, maybe 20% VB code, and 5% everything else. Yes, I \nknow, I could translate the C code into Delphi (assuming I was a sophisticated \nDelphi programmer, not a completely inexperienced Delphi programmer), but that \ncosts as much productivity as I would supposedly gain from your supposedly more \nproductive programming language. And fourth, I already had about 30% of the \ncode I needed for Setup in MFC format: from FogBUGZ 2.0 Setup, and a library \nI\u0027ve been using for years to make wizards. \n\n*\"Why make Setup at all? You already have your customers\u0027 money. Good Setup \nprograms don\u0027t increase sales.\"* This was actually the smartest question and \nmade me think the hardest. I came up with three reasons: \n\n- Decreased tech support cost. This setup program will pay for itself over the \nlife of the code. \n- Delight my customers. When I\u0027m trying to get them to upgrade to 4.0, I want \nthem to remember how painless the 3.0 installation was, so they won\u0027t hesitate \nbecause they are afraid to upgrade. I\u0027m still using an old version of \nSpamAssassin that is becoming increasingly ineffective, even though I know the \nnew version is much better, because I just can\u0027t bear the thought of another \nmorning wasted. The very memory of the first SpamAssassin installation -- all \nthe little SSH windows, some su\u0027ed, trying to scroll through man pages and \nGoogle Groups, accidentally hitting Ctrl+Z in Emacs to undo and having it \nsuspend, trying to guess why we can\u0027t get the MTA to run procmail, sorry it\u0027s \ntoo much. If SpamAssassin was making money off of upgraders they would have \nlost my business because they don\u0027t have a SETUP program. \n- Win reviews. Software reviewers always cast about for some kind of \nstandardized way to rate software, even when they are comparing apples and \noranges and planets and 17th century philosophers. They always have a \nmeaningless list of things to review which can be applied to PC games, \nmainframe databases, web site auction software, and DNA sequencing \nsoftware. And Setup is always on their list. A single flaw in setup is \nguaranteed to be mentioned in every review because every reviewer will see it \nand say \"Aha!\"\n\n\n*\"How can we make WISE[4] better?\" *Kudos to the product manager of WISE \nInstallation System for calling me up and listening to my litany of all the \nreasons his product wasn\u0027t adequate for typical IIS/ASP/SQL applications.\n\n[1] http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/20021002.html\n[2] http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBUGZ\n[3] http://discuss.fogcreek.com/delphiquestions\n[4] http://www.wise.com\n\n",

There\u0027s other stuff, too, eventually, but running is the important \npart. If you can run a mile, run a mile. If you can only run around the block, \nrun around the block. Tomorrow you\u0027ll run around the block, and the next day \nyou\u0027ll find you can run around two blocks. And next week you\u0027ll find you can \nrun a mile. Then one day you\u0027ll run a mile, then stop to catch your breath, \nthen get invigorated and run another mile. \n\nAnd then you\u0027re a runner. That\u0027s it, really. It\u0027s not complicated. You run, and \nyou run, and you run. And one day, you discover that shoes are important, and \nthat the old sneakers you threw on the first time you tried out this running \nthing out aren\u0027t actually very good for running. So you go buy new shoes, and \nyou run, and you run, and you run. And later, you discover that stretching is \nimportant too, so you stretch and run, and stretch and run, and stretch and \nrun. \n\nThere\u0027s other stuff too, but it doesn\u0027t really matter until you\u0027re already a \nrunner. You learn about differences in running surfaces. And how many miles you \nshould really put on one pair of shoes. And when in the day you should run to \nmaximize calorie burning. And how to train for a marathon, and so forth. Don\u0027t \nworry about any of that now. Just run. Running is key. Otherwise you\u0027re just \nanother fat schmuck lying on the couch reading _Runner\u0027s World_.\n\n\n",
